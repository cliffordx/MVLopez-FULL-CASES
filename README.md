# JMVL FULL TEXT CASES
Associate Justice Mario V. Lopez

> NOTE: To date, there are ~~164~~ ~~162~~ **159** full cases in plain text format. Please note that there are currently two Associate Justices with the surname Lopez, one of whom is J.Y. Lopez.
> One particular year was 2020, the ponente was written as 'LOPEZ, J.,' which means that it does not refer to J.Y. Lopez, but rather to M.V. Lopez. Starting in 2021, J.Y. Lopez began appearing in several jurisprudences as the ponente. That is why, beginning in 2021 it was written as `M.V. Lopez.` With that being said, I adapted the notation from 2020 to read 'M.V. LOPEZ, J.` as the ponente discarding the other Lopez.
