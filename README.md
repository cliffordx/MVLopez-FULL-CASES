# MVLopez-FULL-CASES
Associate Justice Mario V. Lopez PONENCIA

## COMPILATION OF CASES from 2020 up to recent 2023.

These plain text files, arranged by year, were extracted from SC jurisprudence and are provided here for reading and digesting purposes.

This compilation might be helpful to those who want to analyze the full text of a case and train a model for their chosen LLM.

Date: 26th September 2023.

> NOTE: To date, there are ~~164~~ ~~162~~ **159** plain text files. Please note that there are currently two Associate Justices with the surname Lopez, one of whom is J.Y. Lopez.
> From 2020 onwards, the ponente was written as 'LOPEZ, J.,' which means that it does not refer to J.Y. Lopez, but rather to M.V. Lopez. Only starting in 2021 did J.Y. Lopez start appearing in several cases. With that being said, I adapted the notation from 2020 to read 'M.V. LOPEZ, J.`
