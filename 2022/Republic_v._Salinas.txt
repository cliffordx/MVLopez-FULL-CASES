SECOND DIVISION
[G.R. No. 238308. October 12, 2022.]
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, petitioner, vs. TERESITA I.
SALINAS, respondent.

RESOLUTION

M.V. LOPEZ, J :
p

The ﬁling date of a pleading submitted to the court through registered
mail is proved by the post oﬃce-stamped date appearing on the envelope of
the pleading or that stated in the registry receipt. 1
For our resolution is a Petition for Review on Certiorari 2 under Rule 45
of the Rules of Court (Rules) ﬁled by petitioner Republic of the Philippines
(Republic), through the Oﬃce of the Solicitor General (OSG), questioning the
Decision 3 dated October 24, 2017 and the Resolution 4 dated March 21,
2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 144681.
Facts
This case stemmed from a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of
Marriage 5 ﬁled by respondent Teresita I. Salinas (Salinas) on the ground of
psychological incapacity, raﬄed to the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch
48 (RTC). The petition was granted in a Decision 6 dated May 13, 2015. The
Republic ﬁled a motion for reconsideration (MR), but was denied in an Order
7 dated July 27, 2015, which it received on August 4, 2015. It, thus, had until
August 19, 2015 to file an appeal. 8

However, the RTC received a Notice of Appeal 9 via registered mail,
contained in an envelope rubber stamped with the date "October 5, 2015,"
10 which it found to be imprinted by the postmaster. Thus, in an Order 11
dated October 15, 2015, the RTC denied the Republic's Notice of Appeal for
being ﬁled late. The Republic moved for reconsideration, positing that its
Notice of Appeal was seasonably ﬁled. To support its claim, the Republic
attached a photocopy of the OSG Inner Registered Sack Bill 12 dated August
18, 2015, which includes entry numbers "18" and "19" 13 or registry
numbers "3495" and "3496," 14 pertaining to a Notice of Appeal purportedly
sent to "RTC Br 48" 15 and Salinas' counsel, Atty. Pacianito B. Cabaron. 16
The OSG bill bears a rubber stamp, stating "ERMITA POST OFFICE Registered
Mail AUG 18 2015." 17 The Republic also ﬁled a supplement to the MR,
attaching a Certiﬁcation 18 dated January 6, 2016 issued by Evelyn B. Jacala,
Postmaster of the Ermita Post Oﬃce, stating that the registered letters with
numbers 3495 and 3496 from the OSG were posted on August 18, 2015. Just
the same, the MR was denied by the RTC in an Order 19 dated December 22,
2015. 20
The Republic challenged the RTC Orders disallowing its Notice ofAppeal through certiorari proceedings before the CA. In its Decision 21 dated
October 24, 2017, the CA found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of
the RTC in denying the Notice of Appeal for being ﬁled beyond the 15-day
reglementary period. The CA considered the OSG Inner Registered Sack Bill
akin to a registry receipt as it contains the following information: Entry
Number "18" and "19," 22 pertaining to a Notice of Appeal with Registry
Numbers "3495" and "3496," 23 sent to "RTC Br 48" 24 and Salinas' counsel,
Atty. Pacianito B. Cabaron, 25 rubber stamped with "ERMITA POST OFFICE
Registered Mail AUG 18 2015." 26 However, the CA observed that the
Republic failed to present an aﬃdavit of the person who purportedly mailed
the Notice of Appeal as required under Section 12, 27 Rule 13 of the Rules.
Under the Rules, a pleading ﬁled via registered mail is proved by presenting
the: (1) registry receipt; and (2) the aﬃdavit of the person who did the
mailing, stating the date of mailing and the particular post oﬃce where the
mail matter was posted. The CA concluded that absent one of the two proofs
of ﬁling, it cannot be concluded that the Republic ﬁled a Notice of Appeal on
or before August 19, 2015. 28 The CA disposed:
Accordingly, we DISMISS the Petition for Certiorari.
IT IS SO ORDERED. 29 (Italics supplied and emphases in the
original)

The Republic ﬁled an MR, which was likewise denied in the assailed CA
Resolution 30 dated March 21, 2018. Hence, this Petition. 31 The Republic
casts doubt on the reliability of the date appearing on the envelope of the
Notice of Appeal, pointing out that the RTC merely surmised that such date
was placed by the postmaster. The Republic maintains that its Notice of
Appeal was timely ﬁled as evidenced by the OSG Inner Registered Sack Bill
and the Certification issued by the postmaster. 32 In her Comment, 33 Salinas
argues that the Republic failed to prove that the Notice of Appeal was ﬁled
on or before August 19, 2015 as it admittedly did not present an aﬃdavit of
the person who mailed the pleading, as required under Section 12, Rule 13
of the Rules. 34 In its Reply, 35 the Republic contends that the Certiﬁcation
issued by the postmaster, who enjoys the presumption of regularity in the
performance of oﬃcial duties, should prevail and take the place of such
affidavit. 36

Issue
Whether the CA erred in ﬁnding no grave abuse of discretion on the
part of the RTC when it denied the Republic's Notice of Appeal for being ﬁled
late.
Ruling
The petition lacks merit.
We emphasize, at the outset, the need to rectify the erroneous reliance
of the parties and the CA in Section 12, now Section 16, Rule 13 of the Rules,
which states:
Section 16.
Proof of ﬁling. — The ﬁling of a pleading or any
other court submission shall be proved by its existence in therecord of the case.
(a)
If the pleading or any other court
submission is not in the record, but is claimed to have
been ﬁled personally, the ﬁling shall be proven by the
written or stamped acknowledgment of its ﬁling by the
clerk of court on a copy of the pleading or court
submission;
(b)
If the pleading or any other court submission
was ﬁled by registered mail, the ﬁling shall be proven by
the registry receipt and by the aﬃdavit of the person who
mailed it, containing a full statement of the date and
place of deposit of the mail in the post oﬃce in a sealed
envelope addressed to the court, with postage fully
prepaid, and with instructions to the postmaster to return
the mail to the sender after ten (10) calendar days if not
delivered.
xxx xxx xxx (Emphasis supplied)

Gleaned from its unequivocal wordings, the provision applies only
when a pleading or any other court submission is claimed to have been ﬁled,
but for some reason, such document cannot be found in the records; 37
hence, the need for proof of its ﬁling. That is not the case here. The
Republic's Notice of Appeal is existing on record, befogged only with doubts
as to when it was ﬁled. In that respect, Section 3, Rule 13 of the Rules 38 is
apropos, viz.:
Section 3.
Manner of ﬁling. — The ﬁling of pleadings and
other court submissions shall be made by:
(a)
Submitting personally the original thereof, plainly
indicated as such, to the court;
(b)

Sending them by registered mail;\n\nxxx xxx xxx
In the ﬁrst case, the clerk of court shall endorse on the pleading
the date and hour of ﬁling. In the second x x x [case,] the date of
the mailing of motions, pleadings, and other court
submissions, and payments or deposits, as shown by the post
oﬃce stamp on the envelope or the registry receipt, shall be
considered as the date of their ﬁling, payment, or deposit in
court. The envelope shall be attached to the record of the
case. x x x (Emphasis supplied)

Plainly, the pleading's ﬁling date can be proved either by: (1) the post
stamp on the envelope, which is considered part of the records; or (2) the
registry receipt. Thus, no grave abuse of discretion can be imputed to the
RTC in considering the date stamped on the envelope of the Republic's
Notice of Appeal, which was October 5, 2015, as the date of the pleading's
filing.
Contrary to the CA's ruling, the photocopy of the OSG Inner Registered
Sack Bill cannot be equated to a registry receipt nor given probative value.
Unlike a registry receipt, the OSG's Inner Registered Sack Bill was not issuedor signed by the postmaster or any authorized receiving personnel of the
concerned post oﬃce; hence, unveriﬁed to be authentic. It was merely a list
of mail matters supposedly sent out by the OSG with corresponding entry
and registry numbers, addressees, and posting dates, stamped with "ERMITA
POST OFFICE Registered Mail AUG 18 2015." 39 Several important entries
were left blank in the invoked document, to wit: name of the dispatching
clerk/witness, "SACK BILL NO.," 40 "PAGE [NO.]," 41 "LOCK NO."; 42 and more
importantly, the total number of articles received by the post oﬃce and the
signature of the "RECEIVING POSTMASTER" 43 or authorized personnel of the
post oﬃce. Thus, even if we admit the authenticity of the OSG Inner Sack
Bill, it cannot be a suﬃcient basis to conclude that the mail matter
pertaining to the Notice of Appeal listed on it was actually dispatched and
received by the Ermita Post Oﬃce on August 18, 2015. Needless to say, no
reasonable mind would rely upon a document with several missing relevant
entries.
The Republic attempted to bolster its claim of timely ﬁling by
presenting a Certiﬁcation issued by the Ermita Post Oﬃce postmaster, which
states:
This is to certify that according to the record of this oﬃce, Registered
Letter Nos. 3495 and 3496 sent by the Oﬃce of the Solicitor General
was posted hereat on August 18, 2015 addressed to RTC Branch 48,
Manila and Atty. Pacianito B. Cabaron, Manila, respectively.

This certiﬁcation is being issued this 6th day of January 2016 upon
request of Paolo V. Quetulio, State Solicitor II, for whatever purpose it
may serve. 44

Contrary to the Republic's argument, this Certiﬁcation does not suﬃce
to prove that it ﬁled its Notice of Appeal on August 18, 2015 given that a
diﬀerent date appears on the envelope containing such pleading. We iterate,
under Section 3, Rule 13 of the Rules, the date of the ﬁling is shown either in
the post oﬃce stamp on the envelope or the registry receipt. Thus, while the
postmaster's certiﬁcation is usually suﬃcient proof of mailing, its evidentiary
value is diﬀerent in this case as it is not merely intended to prove the fact of
mailing, but to prove that the date stamped on the pleading's envelope was
either incorrect due to the post oﬃce's inadvertence or not stamped by the
post oﬃce. 45 We stress, the envelope and the date appearing on it is made
part of the records; hence, it carries the presumption that the date stamped
on it was done in the course of the oﬃcial duties that have been regularly
performed, unless proven otherwise. 46 Starkly, the Certiﬁcation is bereft of
any explanation as to the discrepancy between the date appearing on the
envelope and the date stated in the Certification. 47
At this juncture, it is noteworthy that the Republic provided us with no
means of ascertaining whether the RTC erred in appreciating the
genuineness of the date appearing on the envelope since it did not attach
the Notice of Appeal with the aﬃdavit of service, if any, and the subject
envelope. Not even the pertinent RTC Orders were attached in this petition
for our reference and evaluation. Hence, we are constrained to uphold the
factual ﬁndings of the RTC, which was able to actually see the questioneddocument/s. Besides, this Court is not a trier of facts, and generally, factual
issues cannot be entertained in a Rule 45 petition. 48
Furthermore, the Republic could have conveniently presented the
registry receipt corresponding to its Notice of Appeal, which would have
constituted the best evidence of its claim that it ﬁled its Notice of Appeal on
August 18, 2015, even if a diﬀerent date appears on the envelope. 49
Unfortunately, the Republic failed to present such original receipt nor has it
oﬀered any explanation for its failure to do so, which only leads to a
conclusion that such evidence would operate to its prejudice and support the
case of the adversary. 50
Verily, we ﬁnd no reason to deviate from the CA's conclusion that the
RTC is not guilty of grave abuse of discretion in denying the Republic's
Notice of Appeal for being ﬁled late. The Republic likewise failed to convince
us that it is entitled to the Court's liberality in applying the Rules. Every plea
for a liberal construction of the rules must at least be accompanied by an
explanation of why the party failed to comply with the rules and by a
justiﬁcation for the requested liberality. 51 The Republic did not oﬀer any
explanation as to its failure to present any competent proof of the Notice of
Appeal's date of filing in accordance with Section 3, Rule 13 of the Rules.
ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The
Decision dated October 24, 2017 and the Resolution dated March 21, 2018 of
the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 144681 are AFFIRMED insofar as it
upheld the denial of the Notice of Appeal.

SO ORDERED.
