CONCEPCION CANDARI, respondents.

DECISION

M.V. LOPEZ, J :

"A duly executed contract [or instrument] carries with it the
presumption of validity." 1 Claims adverse to such presumption grounded on
fraud cannot be sustained by mere construction as fraud must be speciﬁcally
alleged and proved in all cases. The party who impugns its regularity has the
burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence of irregularity. 2
This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari 3 ﬁled under
Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court (Rules), assailing the Decision 4 dated
October 30, 2008 and the Resolution 5 dated September 29, 2009 of the
Court of Appeals-Cebu City (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 72998.
FACTS
Adolfo B. Velarde (Adolfo), married to Antonina T. Velarde; Romulo B.
Velarde (Romulo), married to Jean T. Velarde; Bella B. Velarde; Benedicto B.
Velarde (Benedicto); Isabelle V. Diaz; and Carmelita B. Velarde (Carmelita)
(collectively, petitioners) are the legal heirs of Isagani S. Velarde (Isagani). 6


In a notarized Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase dated April 20,
1978, respondent Concepcion Candari (Conception) sold seven 7 parcels of
land located in Aklan to Isagani with the right to repurchase within ﬁve
years. 8 Conception failed to redeem the lots. Thus, in a notarized Deed of
Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights 9 dated February 11, 1986, Concepcion
relinquished absolute ownership of the lots 10 in favor of Isagani and
petitioners as follows: (1) lots under Tax Declaration (TD) Nos. 2318 and
2319 for Isagani; (2) lots under TD No. 2315 for Carmelita; (3) lot under TD
No. 2316 for Adolfo; (4) Lot under TD No. 2317 for Romulo; and (5) lot under
TD No. 10028 in favor of Benedicto. 11 Notably, in 1982, the lot conveyed to
Adolfo is now identiﬁed as Lot No. 287 and registered under Original
Certiﬁcate of Title (OCT) No. P-17480; 12 Romulo's is now identiﬁed as Lot
No. 290 under OCT No. P-17483; 13 and Carmelita's is now identiﬁed as Lot
No. 4280 under OCT No. P-17481. 14 Corresponding TDs 15 were also issued
under Isagani's and petitioners' names.
The other lot subject of this controversy was acquired by Isagani from

Concepcion's sister, Rizalina C. Villamon (Rizalina), through a notarized Deed
of Absolute Sale 16 dated July 1, 1982.
Petitioners averred that after Isagani's death on February 22, 1987,
Concepcion began to represent herself as the owner of the parcels of land by
instituting tenants on portions of the vast lands, collecting rentals, and
appropriating the lands' produce. Their demand upon Concepcion to desist
from usurping their proprietary rights fell on deaf ears, prompting them to
file a complaint for quieting of title and damages. 17
Concepcion, on the other hand, denied having sold or relinquished
ownership and possession of the properties to Isagani or petitioners. She
intimated that she inherited the disputed properties from her father in 1977,
and that she has never shared rentals/produce to Isagani or petitioners. She
claimed that Isagani was merely her lessee, to whom she entrusted the TDs
of all her properties for safekeeping and payment of realty taxes. 18 Hence,
she was surprised when she learned about petitioners' claims. 19 She
accused Isagani and petitioners of having obtained the deeds of
conveyances, as well as the OCTs and TDs, by fraudulent means. 20
Concepcion also claimed that her sister, Rizalina, never sold her property to
Isagani. Thus, as counterclaim, Concepcion asked for damages and the
reconveyance of the properties to her.
In a Decision 21 dated July 5, 2001, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of
Culasi, Antique, Branch 13, granted the complaint for quieting of title. The
RTC found that Concepcion's claims were unsubstantiated, while petitioners
suﬃciently proved their title to the properties by their testimonial and
documentary evidence, thus:
[J]udgment is hereby rendered in favor of [petitioners] and against
[Concepcion], hereby:
(1)
DECLARING [petitioners] as the true and rightful owners
entitled to the possession of the six (6) parcels of land situated in
Pandan, Antique and subject of the present case, and ORDERING
[Concepcion] to vacate and deliver the material possession thereof to
[petitioners];


(2)
DISMISSING [petitioners'] claim and [Concepcion's]
counterclaim for damages; and
(3)

PRONOUNCING no cost.

SO ORDERED. 22

However, on appeal, the CA sustained Concepcion's allegations of
fraud, and consequently, ordered the cancellation of petitioners' OCTs and
TDs, and the reconveyance of all the properties subject of the pacto de retro
sale to Concepcion. 23 As regards the parcel acquired from Rizalina, the CA
held that it was not the proper subject of the action for quieting of title since
there was no showing that Concepcion's claim over it was "apparently valid."
24 In the assailed Decision 25 dated October 30, 2008, the CA disposed:
WHEREFORE, the present appeal is GRANTED. The DECISION
of the [RTC] in Civil Case No. C-031 is hereby REVERSED AND SET
ASIDE. The Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase and Deed of

Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights are both declared NULL AND VOID.
[Petitioners] are HEREBY ORDERED TO RECONVEY to [Concepcion]
the five parcels of land subject of the Deed of Absolute Sale with Right
of Repurchase , within ﬁfteen (15) days from the ﬁnality of this
Decision, and to surrender to her, within the same period, the owner's
duplicate copy of [OCT] No. P-17480, P-17481[,] and P-17483 of the
Registry of Deeds of the Province of Antique.
In the event that [petitioners] fail or refuse to execute the
necessary deed of reconveyance as herein directed, the Clerk of
Court of the [RTC] is HEREBY ORDERED TO EXECUTE THE SAME
at the expense of [petitioners].
Finally, the Municipal Assessor of Pandan, Antique is also
ORDERED TO CANCEL the Tax Declarations in the names of
[petitioners]
over Lots No. 287, 290, 428, 6111 and the
unirrigated riceland situated in Guia, Pandan, Antique with an
area of 12,000 square meters and in lieu thereof, ISSUE the tax
declarations of these properties to [Concepcion].
SO ORDERED. 26 (Emphases and italics in the original; citation
omitted)

Petitioners moved for reconsideration, but was denied in the assailed
CA Resolution 27 dated September 29, 2009.
Hence, this Petition.
ISSUES
Basically, petitioners assert ownership over the disputed properties and
insist that Concepcion's acts of instituting tenants and receiving share from
the produce of the land cloud their title. They also invoke the OCTs and TDs
under their names, and argue that their legal title cannot be collaterally
attacked in an action for quieting of title by unsupported allegations of
fraud. 28


Concepcion, on the other hand, prays for the dismissal of the Petition
initially on procedural grounds. She posits that the Petition failed to comply
with the requirements under Rule 7, Section 5 29 of the Rules since only
three out of the eight petitioners signed the Veriﬁcation and Certiﬁcation
against forum shopping; and there is no showing that the signatories were
authorized by the other petitioners to sign on their behalf. 30 In a
subsequent pleading, 31 Concepcion also argues that the consolidation of
ownership with regard to the properties subject of the pacto de retro sale
without compliance with Article 1607 of the New Civil Code (NCC) was illegal;
32 and maintains her imputation of fraud against Isagani and petitioners. 33
From these arguments, the following issues remain to be resolved:
I.

Whether the petition should be dismissed for failure of all the
petitioners to sign the Veriﬁcation and Certiﬁcate against Forum
Shopping; and,

II.

Whether the action for quieting of title should prosper.
RULING

Before all else, we acknowledge that the complete resolution of the
issues presented before us requires a determination of facts, which the Court
— not being a trier of facts — does not delve into in appeals on certiorari.
There are instances, however, when the Court may proceed to review factual
questions along with the legal ones such as in this case, wherein the factual
findings of the RTC and the CA are conflicting. 34

The Verification and Certification
Against Forum Shopping substantially
complied with the Rules.
The issue on the failure of all the petitioners to sign the
Veriﬁcation/Certiﬁcation is not novel and need not be belabored. We have
consistently held that the requirement on "[v]eriﬁcation is deemed
substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to
the truth of the allegations in the x x x petition signs the veriﬁcation[.]" 35
Similarly, "when all the x x x petitioners share a common interest and invoke
a common cause of action x x x, the signature of only one of them in the
certiﬁcation against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule." 36
Here, petitioners share a common interest and have similar claims on the
properties. Their claims of ownership over the properties against Concepcion
hinge upon the same set of documents, to wit: the Deed of Sale with Right of
Repurchase, the Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights, and the OCTs and
corresponding TDs in their names. Thus, contrary to Concepcion's argument,
the petition is not dismissible merely because only three out of the eight
petitioners signed the Verification/Certification.


Petitioners' complaint actually
constitutes an accion reivindicatoria.
Petitioners' complaint may have been captioned as quieting of title,
but an assiduous examination of petitioners' averments indubitably show
that the remedy sought constitutes an accion reivindicatoria.
An action to quiet title or remove clouds over the title is a special civil
action speciﬁcally governed by Rule 63 of the Rules on declaratory relief and
similar remedies. Distinguished from ordinary civil actions, the subject
matter in special civil actions under Rule 63 is a deed, will, contract or other
written instrument, statute, executive order or regulation, or ordinance. The
issue is the validity or construction of documents; and the relief sought is the
declaration of the parties' rights or duties vis-à-vis , the questioned
documents. Being declaratory in nature, this remedy presupposes that there
has been no breach or violation of the instruments involved, unlike in
ordinary civil actions which necessitates the existence of a violation of a
right as an element of a cause of action. Thus, generally, judgments in
remedies of such nature do not entail any executional process as the only
relief to be properly granted is a declaration of the rights and duties of the
parties under an instrument. 37 Articles 476 and 477 of the NCC state:
ART. 476.
Whenever there is a cloud on title to real property
or any interest therein, by reason of any instrument, record, claim,
encumbrance or proceeding which is apparently valid or eﬀective but

is in truth and in fact invalid, ineﬀective, voidable, or unenforceable,
and may be prejudicial to said title, an action may be brought to
remove such cloud or to quiet the title.
ART. 477.
The plaintiﬀ must have legal or equitable title to,
or interest in the real property which is the subject-matter of the
action. He need not be in possession of said property.

Parsed from these provisions, two indispensable requisites must concur
for an action for quieting of title to prosper, namely: (1) the plaintiﬀ has a
legal or an equitable title to or interest in the real property subject of the
action; and (2) the deed, claim, encumbrance, or proceeding claimed to be
casting cloud on their title must be shown to be in fact invalid or inoperative
despite its prima facie appearance of validity or legal efficacy. 38
Here, petitioners' cause of action is grounded upon their claims of
ownership, which they argue to have been clouded by Concepcion's exercise
of proprietary rights — instituting tenants and collecting rentals and
products. What they perceive as clouds over their title were Concepcion's
intrusive acts of dominion over the properties. In Titong v. Court of Appeals ,
39 we emphatically ruled that physical intrusion is not a ground for quieting
of title. With an allegation of a violation (physical intrusion) of a right
(ownership), petitioners clearly do not seek a declaratory relief or mere
removal of cloud over their title. Ultimately, they seek to recover full
possession of the properties as an element of their ownership, which was
disturbed by Concepcion's physical intrusion. Thus, petitioners' claims and
arguments clearly speak of an accion reivindicatoria — a suit to recover full
possession of a parcel of land as an element of ownership. 40


We have consistently held that the true nature of the action is not
determined by the caption of the pleading, but by the allegations it contain.
The court should grant the relief warranted by the allegations, substantiated
by proof, even if no such relief or a diﬀerent relief is prayed for. 41 Verily, as
the allegations in this case constitute an accion reivindicatoria, the court
should determine ownership of the properties and award possession to the
lawful owner, 42 even if the complaint prayed for the quieting of title. This
was precisely the approach taken by the trial court.
There are two sets of properties involved in this case. First, the lots
subject of the Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase between Concepcion
and Isagani. These properties were likewise the subject of the Deed of
Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights executed by Concepcion in favor of Isagani
and petitioners, wherein Concepcion acknowledged not only her failure to
repurchase, but also Isagani and petitioners' ownership and possession of
the properties. Second , the lot subject of the Deed of Absolute Sale between
Isagani and Rizalina. These properties are now declared under Isagani and
petitioners' names for taxation purposes. As well, three of the parcels of
land, which were the objects of the pacto de retro sale, are now covered by
the OCTs issued by the Register of Deeds of Antique under petitioners'
names, to wit: OCT No. P-17480 (Adolfo); OCT No. P-17483 (Romulo); and
OCT No. P-17481 (Carmelita). Petitioners assert ownership over these
properties as Isagani's heirs, as assignees in the quitclaim and waiver of

rights, and as registered, owners.
To support their claim, petitioners presented the duly notarized deeds
of conveyances. Concepcion, however, denies knowledge of these deeds,
and imputes fraud against Isagani and petitioners in obtaining title to the
properties. She claims that Isagani abused her trust when she left the TDs of
all her properties to him. As regards the property from Rizalina, Concepcion
insists that no sale took place as well between Isagani and Rizalina.
In ruling for Concepcion, the CA found the following circumstances as
"hints of fraud and irregularity" 43 or "indices of [petitioners'] fraudulent
maneuvers" 44 to acquire the properties subject of the pacto de retro sale:
(1) there was no proper consolidation of ownership over the lots subject of
the sale with repurchase as required under Article 1607 45 of the NCC, i.e.,
through judicial order; (2) the Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights was
executed more than two years after the expiration of the redemption period,
and in favor of petitioners who are not the vendees a retro; and (3)
petitioners' OCT's were issued in 1982, i.e., before the expiration of the
agreed redemption period in 1983 and even before Concepcion's quitclaim
and waiver of rights in 1986. 46


The CA was mistaken.
Article 1607 of the NCC states:
ART. 1607.
In case of real property, the consolidation of
ownership in the vendee by virtue of the failure of the vendor to
comply with the provisions of Article 1616 shall not be recorded in
the Registry of Property without a judicial order, after the
vendor has been duly heard. (Emphasis supplied)

Indeed, the provision requires a judicial order before the consolidated
title in a pacto de retro sale may be registered in the Registry of Property.
Such requirement was devised as a counter measure to the prevalent
practice of simulating pacto de retro sales only to circumvent usury laws or
the prohibition against pactum commissorium arrangements, 47 i.e., the
automatic appropriation by the creditor of the thing mortgaged or pledged in
the event of non-payment of the principal obligation. Precisely, to that end,
the law requires courts to determine the true agreement between the parties
or the genuineness of the stipulations in a pacto de retro sale. It goes
without saying then that, without such judicial determination, it is premature
to declare the real intentions of the parties, especially so to conclude that
fraud attended the execution of a pacto de retro sale. Contrary to the CA's
conclusion, thus, mere non-compliance with Article 1607 is not proof of fraud
that would defeat the vendee a retro's title to the properties sold.
On that score, general policies on judicial eﬃciency and economy, and
avoidance of repetitive suits impel this Court to proceed with the required
determination under Article 1607 instead of requiring the parties to undergo
the same judicial process which the proceedings below have already
accomplished. Certainly, the rationale behind Article 1607 has been served
in these proceedings — Concepcion, the vendor a retro, was given due
opportunity to be heard; and the records of this case are suﬃcient for this

Court to write finis the issue on the genuineness of the pacto de retro sale.
Moreover, it is important to consider that this case has been pending for
more than 28 years since the ﬁling of the complaint before the RTC. Any
further delay would only cause undue prejudice to the parties. 48
Verily, records show that the Deed of Sale with Right of Repurchase
and the Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights, wherein Concepcion
acknowledged her failure to redeem, as well as Isagani's and petitioners'
ownership and possession of the properties, were duly notarized documents.
Notably, Concepcion alleged nothing against the true intention of the parties
as stipulated in the pacto de retro sale. Instead, she denies the very
existence of the deeds on the ground of fraud. But her claim of fraud starkly
lacks specificity and proof. The RTC's observation is illuminating, to wit:


[Concepcion's] entire testimony [was] interlaced with the stereotyped
answers in varying negative forms. [A]side from her testimony that
she never sold ﬁve (5) of the disputed parcels of land to [Isagani],
or that she cannot remember having executed a DEED OF
QUITCLAIM AND WAIVER OF RIGHTS dated February 11, 1986, or that
her sister, [Rizalina], never sold the sixth disputed parcel of land
to [Isagani], [Concepcion] also declared that she does not know
that Lots Nos. 287 and 290 are declared in the names of [Isagani] and
[Romulo], and neither does she know that parcel three (3) is
declared in the name of [Carmelita], nor that parcels four (4) and ﬁve
(5) are declared in the name of [Isagani] (TSN, Feb. 10, 1999, Pp. 1519). She also said that she does not know whether one or all six (6)
parcels of land have already been titled in the name of [Isagani] or his
heirs (TSN, Feb. 10, 1996, Pp. 20-21). She likewise stated that she
does not know the wife of [Isagani] x x x nor does she know
[petitioners] (TSN, April 29, 1999, P. 17). Then, when confronted with
certain receipts purportedly signed or witnessed by her, she said she
cannot remember having so witnessed. x x x.
It is most glaring that the testimony of [Concepcion] was
punctuated, in many respects, by mere denials, rife with naked,
unsubstantiated responses of not knowing, or not remembering a fact
or a person, or not having performed an act. x x x.
xxx xxx xxx
The bare denials of [Concepcion] — that she never sold
ﬁve (5) of the six (6) disputed parcels of land, and that
[Isagani] never purchased the sixth parcel of land from
[Rizalina] — cannot prevail over the aﬃrmative testimonies
of [petitioners Adolfo, Romulo], and their witnesses, which
are supported by documents x x x to the eﬀect that
[petitioners] acquired ownership of the properties through
public instruments. 49 (Emphasis supplied)

In this light, we cannot agree with the CA in resorting to inference and
construction to sustain Concepcion's claim of fraud. We must emphasize,
fraud is not presumed; 50 it cannot be demonstrated by mere construction,
but must be proven by the party alleging it in all cases. 51 In contrast,
notarial documents are entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. They
enjoy the presumption of regularity, and are prima facie evidence of the

facts stated therein, which can be overturned only by evidence to the
contrary that is clear and convincing — even preponderant evidence does
not suﬃce. 52 Thus, absent clear and convincing evidence of fraud, the
authenticity and due execution of the notarized deeds must be upheld.
Considering Concepcion's failure to impugn the conveyance under the
pacto de retro sale, the case presents no more basis to invalidate the OCTs
issued to petitioners. "The essence of a pacto de retro sale is that title and
ownership of the property sold are immediately vested in the vendee a retro,
subject [only] to the resolutory condition of repurchase by the vendor a retro
within the stipulated period." 53 Once the vendor a retro fails to redeem the
property within the agreed period, absolute ownership is vested upon the
vendee a retro by operation of law. 54 Here, as agreed upon under the Deed
of Sale with Right of Repurchase, Concepcion had ﬁve years or until 1983 to
repurchase the properties, but as admitted in the quitclaim and waiver of
rights, she failed to do so. 55 Without anything more required from both
parties, thus, irrevocable title to the properties were automatically
transferred to Isagani in 1983 since the resolutory condition was not fulﬁlled.
56 For instance, our pronouncement in Spouses Cruz v. Leis, 57 is highlyinstructive:


It bears stressing that notwithstanding Article 1607, the
recording in the Registry of Property of the consolidation of
ownership of the vendee is not a condition sine qua non to
the transfer of ownership. Petitioners are the owners of the
subject property since [none of the vendors with right to repurchase]
redeemed the same within the one-year period stipulated in the
"Kasunduan." The essence of a pacto de retro sale is that title and
ownership of the property sold are immediately vested in the vendee
a retro, subject to the resolutory condition of repurchase by the
vendor a retro within the stipulated period. Failure thus of the
vendor a retro to perform said resolutory condition vests
upon the vendee by operation of law absolute title and
ownership over the property sold. As title is already vested in
the vendee a retro, his failure to consolidate his title under
Article 1607 of the Civil Code does not impair such title or
ownership for the method prescribed thereunder is merely for
the purpose of registering the consolidated title. 58 (Emphasis
supplied; citation omitted)

Consequently, as Isagani's heirs, petitioners hold an equitable title
over the properties, 59 which justiﬁes the issuance of the OCTs in their
names. This conclusion is conﬁrmed by the Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of
Rights duly executed by Concepcion, wherein she did not only acknowledge
her failure to repurchase the properties, but also, she categorically admitted
that Isagani and petitioners were already the true owners and possessors of
the registered properties. 60 What is more, Concepcion also recognized the
TDs issued in petitioners' names. 61 Hereunder are the excerpts of
Concepcion's categorical recognition of Isagani's and petitioners' rights in
the Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights, made in the presence of two
instrumental witnesses, 62 viz.:

That [parcels of land covered by TD Nos. 2314, 2315, 2316,
2317, 2318, 2319, and 10028] were sold by [Concepcion] to [Isagani]
by virtue of a Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase, on April 20,
1978 x x x, which document was executed before Notary Public
Nicanor Tesorero, at Makato, Aklan and entered in his Notarial
Register as Doc. No. 19; Page 6; Book I; Series of 1978;
That period for redemption of the above-described properties
having elapsed and for reason of other valuable consideration,
[Concepcion] hereby waive and quitclaim [sic] in favor of [Isagani],
the above-described properties under [TD] Nos. 2318 and 2319,
which properties were formerly declared under [TD] Nos. 10621 and
10636, and indicated as parcel[s] 4 and 6 of the aforementioned Deed
of Sale with Right to Repurchase, in favor of [Isagani];
That
[Concepcion]
hereby
acknowledge [sic] that
[Isagani] is now the absolute true owner and possessor of
said parcels of land as declared under [TD] Nos. 2318 and
2319;


That [Concepcion] further states that the parcels of land
as covered by [TD] No. 2315 is now own [sic] and possess
[sic] by [Carmelita] and hereby waive[s] whatever rights and
interest she might have over said property in favor of said
[Carmelita]; that [TD] No. 2316 is now own [sic] and possess
[sic] by [Adolfo,] and [Concepcion] waives whatever rights and
interest she might have over said property in favor of said [Adolfo];
that [TD] No. 2317 is now own [sic] and possess [sic] by
[Romulo,] and [Concepcion] likewise waives whatever rights and
interest she might have over said property in favor of said [Romulo];
and ﬁnally, that [TD] No. 10028 is now own [sic] and possess [sic] by
[Benedicto,] and [Concepcion] likewise waives whatever rights and
interest she might leave over said property in favor of said
[Benecdicto];
That [Concepcion] ﬁnally states, that the properties
covered by [TD] Nos. 2315, 2316, 2317, and 10028 are now
covered by [TD] No. 226 in the name of [Carmelita]; [TD] No.
224 in the name of [Adolfo]; [TD] No. 225 in the name of
[Romulo;] and [TD] No. 66 in the name of [Benedicto],
respectively, who are now the true owner[s] and
possessor[s,]
respectively[,]
of
[the]
above-described
properties[.] 63 (Emphasis supplied)

It is of no moment that the Deed of Quitclaim and Waiver of Rights was
executed only after more than two years from the lapse of the redemption
period, and in favor of petitioners who are not vendees a retro. We stress, by
the very nature of a pacto de retro sale, ownership is automatically vested
upon the vendee a retro by operation of law when the vendor a retro failed to
exercise the right to redeem the properties. Inevitably, the vendor a retro no
longer owns the property sold at that point. Thus, subsequent conveyance of
the unredeemed properties through quitclaim and waiver of rights was,
improper, unnecessary, and a mere surplusage. 64 The irrevocable title of
petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, Isagani, remained intact with or without
such quitclaim and waiver.

As well, at this point, it is irrelevant to consider that the OCTs were
issued before the expiration of the redemption period since petitioners have
suﬃciently proved in these proceedings their equitable title over the
properties. In any case, well-settled is the rule that registration does not
create or vest title as it is not a mode of acquiring ownership. 65 It is merely
the evidence of title. Our land registration laws do not give the holder any
better title than what he or she actually has. Conversely, registration is not a
convenient means to divest ownership rights duly vested through legal
modes of acquiring ownership 66 such as in this case by operation of law.
Therefore, Isagani's irrevocable title remained undefeated by such
premature registration.


Finally, anent the property subject of the Deed of Absolute Sale
between Isagani and Rizalina, we likewise ﬁnd no basis to invalidate the
conveyance. Concepcion's bare allegation against the existence and due
execution of the deed cannot prevail over the prima facie full faith and credit
accorded to it as a notarial document. 67 It is well to note that while
Concepcion denies the execution of the deed, her signature appears on its
face as a witness to the sale. 68
In all, this Court ﬁnds suﬃcient evidence that supports petitioners'
claim of ownership against Concepcion. The duly executed deeds of
conveyances, which were not overturned by Concepcion's unfounded
allegations of fraud, proved Isagani's title over the properties. Hence, as
Isagani's heirs, petitioners are entitled to full ownership over the disputed
properties. 69
ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The
Decision dated October 30, 2008 and the Resolution dated September 29,
2009 of the Court of Appeals-Cebu City in CA-G.R. CV No. 72998 are
REVERSED. The Decision dated July 5, 2001 of the Regional Trial Court of
Culasi, Antique, Branch 13, in Civil Case No. C-031 is REINSTATED.
Petitioners Spouses Adolfo B. Velarde and Antonina T. Velarde, Spouses
Romulo B. Velarde and Jean T. Velarde, Bella B. Velarde, Benedicto B.
Velarde, Isabelle V. Diaz, and Carmelita B. Velarde are declared as the true
and rightful owners entitled to the possession of the disputed properties.

29. SEC. 5. Certification against forum shopping. — The plaintiff or principal party
shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting

a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and
simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he or she has not theretofore
commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any
court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his or her
knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is
such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present
status thereof; and (c) if he or she should thereafter learn that the same or
similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he or she shall report that
fact within five (5) calendar days therefrom to the court wherein his or her
aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.
xxx xxx xxx
Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by
mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be
cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise
provided, upon motion and after hearing. The submission of a false
certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall
constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding
administrative and criminal actions. If the acts of the party or his or her
counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same
shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute
direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions.
