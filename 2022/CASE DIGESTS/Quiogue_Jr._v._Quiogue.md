## PRINCIPLE:
A marriage contracted by any party, who at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization. (ART. 36, FC)

**SYNOPSIS:** Antonio filed for annulment claiming psychological incapacity, which was granted by RTC but reversed by CA. He is now appealing to the Supreme Court.

## FACTS:
Petitioner Antonio S. Quiogue, Jr. filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage (Civil Case No. Q02-46137) in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 88, Quezon City, against his wife, respondent Maria Bel B. Quiogue (Maribel). Antonio alleged that they were married on October 16, 1980, and they had four children. They had been separated since 1998, and he claimed that both he and Maribel were psychologically incapacitated to fulfill their marital obligations, lacking mutual love, respect, and support.

Maribel denied the allegations, saying Antonio voluntarily left due to womanizing and gambling. She accused him of verbally abusing her. She argued that Antonio voluntarily left their home. 

During the trial, witnesses, including Antonio, his office staff Gemarie Martin, and a psychiatrist, Dr. Valentina Del Fonso Garcia, testified about the couple's marital issues. Dr. Garcia recommended the nullification of the marriage based on psychological incapacity.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted the petition in a decision dated May 8, 2008, declaring the marriage null and void under Article 36 of the Family Code. It found both parties psychologically incapacitated.

However, on appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the RTC decision, stating that the infidelity and irreconcilable differences between Antonio and Maribel did not constitute psychological incapacity. The CA also questioned the conclusiveness of Dr. Garcia's evaluation.


Now, petitioner Antonio is seeking a reversal of the CA's decision, arguing that the evidence, including their family backgrounds and the events during their marriage, supports the finding of psychological incapacity.

The Solicitor General opposes the petition, asserting that Antonio failed to prove the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of his alleged psychological incapacity. The Solicitor General maintains that the evidence primarily indicates grounds for legal separation, not the nullity of the marriage.


## ISSUE:
WON psychological incapacity was sufficiently proven given the parties' circumstances and expert evaluation.

## RULING:
Yes. The marriage between Antonio S. Quiogue, Jr., and Maribel Bel B. Quiogue is declared VOID on ground of Antonio's psychological incapacity.

Psychological incapacity is a valid ground to declare a marriage void under Article 36 of the Family Code. Incurability is now viewed legally rather than medically, contemplating an enduring personality dysfunction undermining the marriage. 

The decision hinges on the interpretation of Article 36 of the Family Code, which allows for the declaration of marriage as void if one party was psychologically incapacitated to fulfill essential marital obligations at the time of the marriage, even if this incapacity becomes apparent only later. 

The court emphasizes three key criteria for psychological incapacity: gravity, antecedence, and incurability.

**Gravity**
- The court emphasizes that Antonio's chronic infidelity, deeply rooted in his psychopathology, constitutes a form of psychological incapacity. This is not merely occasional marital indiscretion but a longstanding pattern that negatively affected the marriage.

**Antecedence**
- Antonio's infidelity and psychological issues existed even before the marriage, as evidenced by his history of short-lived relationships and a dysfunctional family background. This demonstrates that his psychological incapacity predated the marriage.

**Incurability**
- The court points out that Antonio's inability to acknowledge the gravity of his infidelity and his lack of desire to change his behavior to save the marriage make his incapacity incurable. His distorted view of the essential obligations of marriage, including fidelity, further supports this argument.

In this case, Maribel's statements during interviews regarding their daughter's treatment, together with other evidence, supports Antonio's psychological incapacity claim. Antonio's chronic infidelity satisfies the requirements of Article 36 - it has juridical antecedence based on his dysfunctional childhood and relationships pre-marriage. His infidelity is grave in nature as he fails to recognize fidelity as a core obligation and blames Maribel instead of taking responsibility. His incapacity is incurable as it persisted throughout the marriage and was specifically directed at Maribel. Maribel's angry reactions were due to Antonio's contemptuous treatment but do not amount to her own psychological incapacity as they only existed during the marriage. 


## DOCTRINES:

- Article 36 of the Family Code of the Philippines allows for the declaration of nullity of a marriage on the ground of psychological incapacity. This incapacity pertains to a party's inability to fulfill essential marital obligations at the time of marriage celebration. If a marriage is patently ill-equipped to cope with the complexities of marriage and if there is clear evidence of psychological incapacity, it may be declared void to preserve the essence of marriage as an institution.

- An actual medical examination of the person concerned need not be resorted to if the totality of the evidence presented is sufficient to sustain a finding of psychological incapacity. The focus is on the evidence demonstrating the incapacity rather than strict medical proof.

### PERSONALITY STRUCTURE:

**ANTONIO**
- Antonio's admission that he would always be cheating on his wife, indicating a lack of remorse or commitment to monogamy. 
- He is blaming Maribel's nagging and tactlessness for his infidelity, rather than taking responsibility for his actions.
- Failure to show sincere remorse for his blatant infidelity and a lack of desire to change his behavior to save their marriage.

**MARIBEL**
- The discovery of Antonio's infidelity led to anger and a shift in her behavior from nurturing to rage.
- Maribel's vengeful acts, such as sending vulgar fax messages and hateful letters, and evicting Antonio from the conjugal home. Her behavior, while aggressive, was largely a reaction to Antonio's philandering and was not present before their marriage.


## BAR Q & A:

Maribel filed a petition for the declaration of nullity of her marriage with Antonio, alleging his psychological incapacity to fulfill essential marital obligations. She claimed that Antonio's chronic infidelity and his inability to maintain a monogamous relationship were clear manifestations of his psychological incapacity. During the trial, Maribel presented evidence of Antonio's philandering behavior both before and during their marriage. Antonio, on the other hand, argued that Maribel's retaliatory actions, such as sending vulgar messages and evicting him from their home, also amounted to psychological incapacity.

*Should Maribel's petition for the declaration of nullity of their marriage on the grounds of Antonio's psychological incapacity be granted?* **Explain.** 

**SUGGESTED ANSWER:**

Yes, Maribel's petition for the declaration of nullity of her marriage with Antonio should be granted based on Antonio's psychological incapacity. The concept of psychological incapacity as a ground for the nullity of marriage is governed by Article 36 of the Family Code.

Article 36 provides that "A marriage contracted by any party, who at the time of the celebration, was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations of marriage, shall likewise be void even if such incapacity becomes manifest only after its solemnization."

In this case, Maribel has presented compelling evidence of Antonio's chronic infidelity, which constitutes a form of psychological incapacity. Infidelity can be considered a manifestation of psychological incapacity if it satisfies the criteria of gravity, antecedence, and incurability. Antonio's repeated infidelity and his inability to maintain a monogamous relationship demonstrate the gravity of his incapacity. The evidence presented during the trial also shows that Antonio's infidelity existed both before and during the marriage. This fulfills the requirement of antecedence, as his psychological issues predated the marriage. 

As to incurability, Antonio's inability to acknowledge the seriousness of his infidelity and his failure to show sincere remorse or a desire to change his behavior for the sake of the marriage indicate incurability. He persistently engaged in extramarital relationships, and his distorted view of marital obligations, including fidelity, supports the conclusion of incurability.


Therefore, considering the evidence presented and the legal principles governing psychological incapacity, Maribel's petition for the declaration of nullity of her marriage with Antonio should be granted based on Antonio's psychological incapacity, meeting the criteria of gravity, antecedence, and incurability.
