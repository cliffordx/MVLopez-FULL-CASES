## PRINCIPLE:

1. The alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property, without the wife's consent, made before the effectivity of the Family Code, is not void but merely voidable. The applicable laws are Articles 166 and 173 of the New Civil Code. The wife may file an action for annulment of contract within ten (10) years from the transaction; and

2. The alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property, without the authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse, made after the effectivity of the Family Code is void. The applicable law is Article 124 of the Family Code without prejudice to vested rights in the property acquired before August 3, 1988. Unless the transaction is accepted by the non-consenting spouse or is authorized by the court, an action for declaration of nullity of the contract may be filed before the continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse and the third person becomes ineffective.

## FACTS:

Spouses Jorge Escalona (Jorge) and Hilaria Escalona (Hilaria; collectively, Spouses Escalona) acquired unregistered Lots 1 and 2 in Olongapo City. Lot 1 has an area of 92,075 sqm while Lot 2 has an area of 8,300 sqm. In 1998, Jorge waived his rights over Lot 1 in favor of his illegitimate son Reygan. However, his wife Hilaria did not consent to this waiver.

In 2005, Reygan transferred Lot 1 to Belinda through deeds of waiver and quitclaim. He also transferred Lot 2 to Belinda. They later entered into a deed of absolute sale for both lots.Sps Escalona confronted Belinda, saying Reygan had no authority to sell the lots. However, Belinda claimed the transactions were valid. 

Sps Escalona filed a case to annul the documents in 2005. The RTC dismissed the case, ruling it was time-barred. The CA reversed, finding the lots were conjugal properties requiring Hilaria's consent. Without this, the waiver by Jorge and subsequent transactions of Reygan were void. Belinda argues she was a buyer in good faith. But the CA ruled she should have investigated further given deficiencies in the documents.


## ISSUE:

Wwhether the transactions involving Reygan are valid without Hilaria's consent, as the lots are alleged to be conjugal properties.

## RULING:

The transaction is void. The Supreme Court ruled that the transactions involving Lot Nos. 1 and 2 between Reygan and Belinda, including the Deed of Absolute Sale, are invalid. These transactions were considered void due to the lack of consent from both spouses, rendering them without legal effect.

Article 124 of the Family Code provides the joint administration and enjoyment of conjugal partnership properties by both spouses. In cases of disagreement, the husband's decision prevails, but the wife can challenge it in court within five years. If one spouse cannot participate in property administration, the other may assume sole control. However, such powers do not extend to disposing of or encumbering conjugal assets without court approval or the written consent of the other spouse. Without such consent, any transaction is void, but it's considered a continuing offer and may become a binding contract if accepted by the other spouse or authorized by the court before either party withdraws the offer.

The confusion arises from determining which legal provisions should apply to property transactions based on the timing of the marriage and the transactions themselves. The applicable law depends on whether the marriage and property transactions occurred before or after the Family Code's effectivity.

Thus, it is an opportune time for the Supreme Court to clarify any confusion besetting the applicable laws and jurisprudence in transactions involving alienation or encumbrance of conjugal properties, without consent of the other spouse, which is determinative of the remedies available to the aggrieved parties and the prescriptive period of actions. The Supreme Court holds that more than the date of the marriage of the spouses, the applicable law must be reckoned on the date of the alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property made without the consent of the other spouse, to wit:

1. The alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property, without the wife's consent, made before the effectivity of the Family Code, is not void but merely voidable. The applicable laws are Articles 166 and 173 of the New Civil Code. The wife may file an action for annulment of contract within ten (10) years from the transaction; and

2. The alienation or encumbrance of the conjugal property, without the authority of the court or the written consent of the other spouse, made after the effectivity of the Family Code is void. The applicable law is Article 124 of the Family Code without prejudice to vested rights in the property acquired before August 3, 1988. Unless the transaction is accepted by the non-consenting spouse or is authorized by the court, an action for declaration of nullity of the contract may be filed before the continuing offer on the part of the consenting spouse and the third person becomes ineffective.
