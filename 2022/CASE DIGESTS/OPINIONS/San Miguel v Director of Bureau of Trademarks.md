# J. M. V. Lopez Concurring & Dissenting Opinion

Title: 'San Miguel v. Director of the Bureau of Trademarks, G.R. No. 196372. August 09, 2022'

The concurring opinion agrees with the majority on certain points in the trademark case involving Ginebra San Miguel and Tanduay Distillers, Inc. Justice Mario Lopez acknowledges that "GINEBRA" is not a generic term and supports the idea that it functions as a distinctive mark associated with Ginebra San Miguel's gin products. It argues that the examination of a trademark application should not solely rely on translation but should also consider the local understanding and usage of the term.

Furthermore, the contention that "GINEBRA" falls under the category of suggestive marks, hinted at the nature or attributes of gin products rather than being merely descriptive. It expresses concern about potential confusion of goods if other manufacturers are allowed to use the term "GINEBRA" on their gin products.

On the dissenting side, the opinion questions the majority's interpretation of the law, specifically the possibility of a generic term evolving into a descriptive one and being eligible for trademark registration. The dissenting opinion argues that such an interpretation blurs the distinction between generic and descriptive marks, and it insists on the clear language of the law that excludes generic marks from protection.

Additionally, the dissent disagrees with the majority's conclusion that there is no likelihood of confusion between "GINEBRA KAPITAN" and "GINEBRA SAN MIGUEL." It emphasizes the similarities in bottle shape, label content, and the word "GINEBRA," suggesting that these elements could lead to confusion among consumers. The dissenting opinion ultimately disagrees with the majority's decision on the trademark case.

## Doctrines and Principles

4. **Secondary Meaning:**
   - Even if "GINEBRA" was originally generic, evidence may be presented to establish that it has acquired distinctiveness (secondary meaning).

5. **Statutory Construction:**
   - The law is clear and should not be extended to include generic marks under the provision related to distinctiveness.

6. **Unfair Competition:**
   - The elements of unfair competition emphasize confusing similarity in the general appearance of goods and the intent to deceive the public. The majority concludes that there is no trademark infringement but upholds findings of unfair competition.

7. **Survey Evidence:**
