SECOND DIVISION
[G.R. No. 250852. October 10, 2022.]
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, plaintiff-appellee, vs. JOHN
FRANCIS SUALOG, accused-appellant.

DECISION

M.V. LOPEZ, J :

The presence of qualifying circumstances raising the killing to the
category of murder is the core issue in the Appeal before this Court assailing
the Court of Appeals-Cebu City's (CA) Decision 1 dated May 31, 2019 in CAG.R. CEB-CR-HC
No. 02515.


ANTECEDENTS
John Francis Sualog (John Francis) was charged with three counts of
murder committed against Amado Chavez Maglantay (Amado), Eppie U.
Maglantay (Eppie), and Jessa Amie U. Maglantay (Jessa) before the Regional
Trial Court of Culasi, Antique, Branch 13 (RTC), docketed as Criminal Case
Nos. L-505, L-506, and L-507, respectively, to wit:
[Criminal Case No. L-505]
That on or about the 12th day of October, 2003, in the
Municipality of Libertad, Province of Antique, Republic of the
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court[,] the
above-named accused being then armed with a bolo, with intent to
kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack,
assault, hack[,] and stab with said bolo one Amado Maglantay
thereby inﬂicting upon the latter fatal wounds on the vital parts of his
body which caused his instantaneous death.
With the qualifying aggravating circumstances of evident
premeditation, treachery, taking advantage of nighttime and
superior strength and the commission of the oﬀense was
characterized by cruelty and adding ignominy to the natural
effects of the crime.
Contrary to the provisions of Article 248 of the Revised Penal
Code, as amended by Republic Act [No.] 7659.
[Criminal Case No. L-506]
That on or about the 12th day of October, 2003, in the

Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court[,] the
above-named accused being then armed with a bolo, with intent to
kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack,
assault, hack[,] and stab with said bolo one Eppie U. Maglantay
thereby inﬂicting upon the latter fatal wounds on the vital parts of her
body which caused her instantaneous death.

With the qualifying aggravating circumstances of evident
premeditation, treachery, taking advantage of nighttime and
superior strength and the commission of the oﬀense was
characterized by cruelty and adding ignominy to the natural
effects of the crime.
Contrary to the provisions of Article 248 of the Revised Penal
Code, as amended by Republic Act [No.] 7659.
[Criminal Case No. L-507]
That on or about the 12th day of October, 2003, in the
Municipality of Libertad, Province of Antique, Republic of the
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court[,] the
above-named accused being then armed with a bolo, with intent to
kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack,
assault, hack[,] and stab with said bolo one Jessa Amie U.
Maglantay thereby inflicting upon the latter fatal wounds on the vital
parts of her body which caused her instantaneous death.
With the qualifying aggravating circumstances of evident

characterized by cruelty and adding ignominy to the natural
effects of the crime.
Contrary to the provisions of Article 248 of the Revised Penal
Code, as amended by Republic Act [No.] 7659. 2 (Emphases supplied)

Upon arraignment, John Francis pleaded guilty. The RTC did not require
the prosecution to present evidence to prove the precise degree of John
Francis' culpability although the charges involved a capital oﬀense. The RTC
merely asked clariﬁcatory questions to John Francis regarding the
voluntariness and consequences of his plea of guilt. On June 10, 2004, the
RTC convicted John Francis with three counts of murder and imposed upon
him the penalty of death for each case. The RTC then forwarded the case to
the Court for automatic review. On June 7, 2005, the Court transferred the
case to the CA for appropriate action. On August 30, 2012, the CA remanded
the case to the RTC to prove John Francis' precise degree of culpability. 3
Trial then ensued.
The prosecution presented April Magsipoc (April), SPO2 Judy Lucas
(SPO2 Lucas), and Dr. Teresita Escondo (Dr. Escondo) as witnesses. April
testiﬁed that she is the foster daughter of the Maglantay family. On October
12, 2003, at around 2:00 a.m., April was inside her bedroom when she heard
her foster father, Amado yelled "Aahhh." Also, April heard her foster mother
Eppie say "Aah!" Alarmed, April got up from bed and turned on the light.
When April opened her bedroom door, she saw John Francis hacking her
sister, Jessa, with a bolo. Immediately, April turned oﬀ the light, locked the
door, and remained quiet. April was scared that John Francis would kill her
next. After a few minutes, April peeped through the window and noticed John
Francis leaving the house. April then went to the living room where she saw
the lifeless bodies of Amado, Eppie, and Jessa. April knew John Francis
because he is their neighbor who frequently ran errands for them. SPO2

Lucas narrated that she and other police oﬃcers investigated the incident,
took photographs of the crime scene, and recovered the murder weapon.
Meanwhile, Dr. Escondo examined the bodies of the victims and concluded
that they died because of severe blood loss due to multiple stab wounds. 4
On the other hand, John Francis waived his right to present evidence.5
On January 5, 2016, the RTC found John Francis guilty of three counts
of murder and appreciated the qualifying circumstances of treachery,
evident premeditation, and unlawful entry, 6 thus:
WHEREFORE, premises
rendered as follows:

considered,

judgment

is

hereby

In Criminal Case No. L-505, accused John Francis Sualog is
hereby found "guilty" beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
Murder for the death of Amado Chavez Maglantay and is hereby
sentenced to suﬀer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua . He is further
directed to pay the heirs of the deceased victim the amount of

and [P]75,000.00 as exemplary damages;
In Criminal Case No. L-506, accused John Francis Sualog is
hereby found ["]guilty["] beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of

directed to pay the heirs of the deceased victim the amount of
[P]75,000.00 as civil indemnity; [P]100,000.00 as moral damages[;]
and [P]75,000.00 as exemplary damages; and
In Criminal Case No. L-507, accused John Francis Sualog is

directed to pay the heirs of the deceased victim the amount of
[P]75,000.00 as civil indemnity; [P]100,000.00 as moral damages[;]
and [P]75,000.00 as exemplary damages[.]
SO ORDERED. 7

Aggrieved, John Francis elevated the case to the CA which was
docketed as CA-G.R. CEB-CR-HC No. 02515. John Francis argued that the
prosecution failed to allege the speciﬁc facts constituting the qualifying
aggravating circumstances and to prove the essential elements of murder. 8
In contrast, the Oﬃce of the Solicitor General countered that treachery
qualiﬁed the killing to murder. The weapon used, coupled with the location
and number of the wounds, showed John Francis' clear intent to kill the
unsuspecting victims. 9
On May 31, 2019, the CA aﬃrmed John Francis' conviction for three
counts of murder. The CA explained that John Francis is deemed to have
waived any objection against the suﬃciency of the Informations for his
failure to question any defect in the charges during the trial. The CA also
ruled that the prosecution proved treachery considering that the attack was
carried out in a sudden and unexpected manner. The mode of attack
deprived the victims of any real opportunity to defend themselves. The

victims were inside their room when John Francis entered the house in the
middle of the night and attacked them with a bolo. Nonetheless, the CA
discounted the presence of evident premeditation absent evidence as to
when John Francis came up with the determination to commit the crime. The
CA, likewise, did not appreciate unlawful entry because it was not alleged in
the Informations while nighttime is absorbed in treachery. Lastly, the CA
reduced the amount of moral damages and corrected the obvious clerical
error in the dispositive portion of the RTC's decision in that the name of the
victim in Criminal Case No. L-507 should be "Jessa Amie Maglantay" and not
"Amado Chavez Maglantay," 10 viz.:
WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated January
5, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 13, Culasi, Antique in
Criminal Case Nos. L-505, L-506 and L-507 is AFFIRMED with
MODIFICATION. The name of the victim in the dispositive portion of
Criminal Case No. L-507 is changed to Jessa Amie Maglantay. Moral
damages is reduced to Php75,000.00. The amount of civil indemnity
and exemplary damages is sustained. The damages herein awarded
are subject to interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the
date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.
SO ORDERED. 11

Hence, the Appeal before this court.
The parties opted not ﬁle supplemental briefs considering that all
issues have already been exhaustively discussed in their pleadings before
the CA. Thus, John Francis reiterates his arguments that the prosecution
failed to establish the elements of murder and its qualifying circumstances.
12

RULING
The Appeal is partly meritorious.
We stress that the CA and the RTC's assessments on the credibility of
the prosecution witnesses and the veracity of their testimonies are given the
highest degree of respect, 13 especially if there are no facts or
circumstances of weight or substance that were overlooked, misunderstood,
or misapplied, which could affect the result of the case. 14 Moreover, the trial
court has the best opportunity to determine the credibility of the prosecution
witnesses, having evaluated their emotional state, reactions, and overall
demeanor in open court.


Here, April positively identiﬁed John Francis as the perpetrator of the
crimes. April was familiar with John Francis because he is their neighbor who
frequently ran errands for them. More importantly, April was at the crime
scene when the killings happened. Well settled is the rule that "the most
natural reaction of a witness to a crime is to strive to look at the appearance
of the perpetrator and to observe the manner in which the oﬀense is
perpetrated." 15 Also, April has no motive to perjure against John Francis
other than to see that justice is done. The earnest desire to seek Justice will
not be served had April abandoned her conscience and prudence to blame
one who is innocent of the crime.

Notably, John Francis raises for the ﬁrst time on appeal that treachery
and evident premeditation were not properly alleged in the Informations
which deprived him of the right to be informed of the nature and the cause of
the accusation. In People v. Solar, 16 the Court held that "it is insuﬃcient for
prosecutors to indicate in the Information that the act supposedly committed
by the accused was done 'with treachery' x x x or 'with evident
premeditation' without speciﬁcally describing the acts done by the accused
that made any or all of such circumstances present." 17 Yet, the failure of the
accused to question the Information through a motion to quash or a motion
for bill of particulars constitutes a waiver of the defective statement of
aggravating and qualifying circumstances, to wit:
In sum, the Court, continually cognizant of its power and
mandate to promulgate rules concerning the protection and
enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and
procedure in all courts, hereby lays down the following guidelines
for the guidance of the Bench and the Bar:
1.

Any Information which alleges that a qualifying or
aggravating circumstance — in which the law uses a
broad term to embrace various situations in which it
may exist, such as but are not limited to (1)
treachery; (2) abuse of superior strength; (3)
evident premeditation; (4) cruelty — is present,
must state the ultimate facts relative to such
circumstance. Otherwise, the information may be subject
to a motion to quash under Section 3(e) (i.e., that it does
not conform substantially to the prescribed form), Rule 117
of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, or a motion for
a bill of particulars under the parameters set by said Rules.

Failure of the accused to avail any of the said remedies
constitutes a waiver of his right to question the defective
statement of the aggravating or qualifying circumstance in
the Information, and consequently, the same may be
appreciated against him if proven during trial.
Alternatively, prosecutors may suﬃciently aver the
ultimate facts relative to a qualifying or aggravating
circumstance by referencing the pertinent portions of the
resolution ﬁnding probable cause against the accused, which
resolution should be attached to the Information in
accordance with the second guideline below.
2.

Prosecutors must ensure compliance with Section 8(a),
Rule 112 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure that
mandates the attachment to the Information the resolution
ﬁnding probable cause against the accused. Trial courts
must ensure that the accused is furnished a copy of this
Decision prior to the arraignment.

3.

Cases which have attained ﬁnality prior to the
promulgation of this Decision will remain ﬁnal by virtue of
the principle of conclusiveness of judgment.

4.

For cases which are still pending before the trial court, the

prosecution, when still able, may ﬁle a motion to amend
the Information pursuant to the prevailing Rules in order to
properly allege the aggravating or qualifying circumstance
pursuant to this Decision.
5.

For cases in which a judgment or decision has already
been rendered by the trial court and is still pending appeal,
the case shall be judged by the appellate court depending
on whether the accused has already waived his right to
question the defective statement of the aggravating or
qualifying circumstance in the Information, (i.e., whether
he previously ﬁled either a motion to quash under Section
3(e), Rule 117, or a motion for a bill of particulars)
pursuant to this Decision. 18 (Emphases supplied; citations
omitted)

In this case, the Informations against John Francis were defective
absent factual details describing the qualifying circumstances of treachery
and evident premeditation. However, John Francis waived such defects when
he failed to avail of the proper remedies under procedural rules. John Francis
did not question the insufficiency of the Informations either through a motion
to quash or a motion for bill of particulars. John Francis only raised the issue
on appeal and not at the trial. Accordingly, the qualifying circumstances of
treachery and evident premeditation may be appreciated against John
Francis if proven during trial.
Corollarily, treachery exists when the oﬀender commits any of the
crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the
execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution,
without risk to them arising from the defense which the offended party might
make. In order for treachery to be appreciated, two requirements must be
established: "(1) the victim was in no position to defend himself or herself
when attacked; and, (2) the assailant consciously and deliberately adopted
the methods, means, or form of one's attack against the victim." 19 Contrary
to the CA and the RTC's ﬁndings, treachery should be ruled out for failure of
the prosecution to demonstrate how the accused commenced and executed
the attack upon the victims, 20 thus:
In a catena of cases, the Court has consistently ruled
that treachery cannot be appreciated where the prosecution
only proved the events after the attack happened, but not the
manner of how the attack commenced or how the act which
resulted in the victim's death unfolded. In treachery, there must
be clear and convincing evidence on how the aggression was made,
how it began, and how it developed. Where no particulars are known
as to the manner in which the aggression was made or how the act
which resulted in the death of the victim began and developed, it
cannot be established from the suppositions drawn only from the
circumstances prior to the very moment of the aggression, that an
accused perpetrated the killing with treachery. Accordingly,
treachery cannot be considered where the lone witness did
not see the commencement of the assault. 21 (Emphases
supplied; citations omitted)

Here, April neither saw the commencement of the assault nor the
unfolding of the events that ultimately resulted in the death of the
Maglantay family. April chanced upon a slim portion or momentary episode
of the attack. 22 Thereafter, April hid from John Francis. The prosecution also
did not establish with moral certainty that the three victims were utterly
oblivious to the impending attack or that they had no opportunity to mount a
meaningful defense. Inarguably, there was reasonable doubt on how the
aggression started, developed, and ended.
Whereas, evident premeditation has the following elements, viz.: "(1)
the time when the oﬀender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act
manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to his determination; [and] (3)
a suﬃcient lapse of time between the determination and execution to allow
him to reﬂect upon the consequences of his act." 23 Speciﬁcally, the
prosecution must establish that a suﬃcient amount of time had lapsed
between the malefactor's determination and execution. 24 The Court will not
appreciate evident premeditation absent showing that there was enough
time that had lapsed between the conception and execution of the crime to
allow the accused to reflect upon the consequences of their acts. 25
Meanwhile, there is no evidence as to the period of time when John
Francis resolved to commit the crime and had cool thought and reﬂection to
arrive at a calm judgment. April did not testify on this matter and even
attested that she was unaware of any quarrel between John Francis and her
foster family. 26 It must be emphasized that "[t]he premeditation to kill must
be plain and notorious; it must be suﬃciently proven by evidence of outward
acts showing the intent to kill. In the absence of clear and positive evidence,
mere presumptions and inferences of evident premeditation, no matter how
logical and probable, are insuﬃcient." 27 Verily, the CA correctly discounted
evident premeditation because there is no proof as to how and when the
plan to kill was decided, and how much time had elapsed before it was
carried out.
The Informations also alleged the aggravating circumstances of
nighttime, abuse of superior strength, cruelty, and ignominy. 28 In the same
vein, the Court cannot consider these circumstances. Nighttime could not be
appreciated as an aggravating circumstance absent evidence suggesting
that John Francis especially sought or took advantage of nocturnity to
facilitate the commission of the crime or conceal his identity as he stabbed
the victims inside their home. 29 Likewise, abuse of superior strength
requires the purposeful use of excessive force out of proportion to the means
of defense available to the person attacked. 30
Also, the prosecution failed to present evidence to show the relative
disparity in age, size, strength, or force between John Francis and his
victims. The presence of John Francis who was armed with a bolo, is
insuﬃcient to indicate superior strength against the three unarmed victims.
31 Neither ignominy nor cruelty attended the commission of the crimes.
Ignominy refers to the means employed by the accused that adds disgrace
and obloquy to the material injury caused by the crime. 32 In cruelty, "it must
be shown that the accused, for his pleasure and satisfaction, caused the

victim to suﬀer slowly and painfully as he inﬂicted on him unnecessary
physical and moral pain." 33 However, the inﬂiction of multiple stab wounds
upon the Maglantay family does not denote the deliberate intention on the
part of John Francis to humiliate them 34 or increase their suffering. 35
Taken together, John Francis is liable only for three counts of homicide
for failure of the prosecution to prove the alleged qualifying circumstances.
On this point, it must be recalled that John Francis entered a plea of guilty
when he was arraigned. 36 The mitigating circumstance of plea of guilt has
the following elements, to wit: "(1) that the oﬀender spontaneously
confessed his guilt; (2) that the confession of guilt was made in open court,
that is, before the competent court that is to try the case; and (3) that the
confession of guilt was made prior to the presentation of evidence for the
prosecution." 37 All these requisites are present in these cases. Upon
arraignment, John Francis timely pleaded guilty to all the charges before the
trial ensued, or before the prosecution presented its evidence. Hence, this
circumstance may be appreciated in favor of John Francis to determine his
appropriate penalty.
Under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, the prescribed penalty for
homicide is reclusion temporal. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law,
and considering the presence of one mitigating circumstance, the maximum
term of the is determinate sentence should be taken from the minimum
period of the prescribed penalty, or between twelve (12) years and one (1)
day to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months. On the other hand, the
minimum term must be within the range of the penalty next lower in degree
from that prescribed for the crime or prision mayor, in any of its periods,
which has a range of six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years.
Thus, the Court modiﬁes the penalty and imposes upon accused-appellant
the indeterminate sentence of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor,
as minimum, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as
maximum, for each count.
As to the civil liability of accused-appellant, the Court deems it proper
to award P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral damages, and
P50,000.00 temperate damages for each count, consistent with the
prevailing jurisprudence. 38 However, the grant of exemplary damages is
deleted in the absence of any aggravating circumstance. 39 The award of
damages shall all earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from ﬁnality of
this Decision until fully paid.
ACCORDINGLY, the Appeal is DISMISSED. The Court of Appeals'
Decision dated May 31, 2019 in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-HC No. 02515 is AFFIRMED
with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant John Francis Sualog is GUILTY of
three counts of homicide and is sentenced to suﬀer the indeterminate
penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to
twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, for
each count. Accused-appellant John Francis Sualog is likewise. DIRECTED to
pay the heirs of the victims P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral
damages, and P50,000.00 temperate damages for each count, all with legal
interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the ﬁnality of this Decision until

full payment. Lastly, the grant of exemplary damages is deleted for lack of
factual and legal bases.


SO ORDERED.
