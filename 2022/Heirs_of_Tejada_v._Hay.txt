SECOND DIVISION
[G.R. No. 250542. October 10, 2022.]
HEIRS OF PIO TEJADA AND SOLEDAD TEJADA, represented
by PIO DOMINGO TEJADA, petitioners, vs. GARRY B. HAY, in
substitution of MYRNA L. HAY, represented by his Attorneyin-Fact, GOMERCINDO * LITONG,
respondent.

DECISION

M.V. LOPEZ, J :

Bona ﬁde amendments to pleadings are allowed at any stage of the
proceedings so that every case may, as much as possible, be determined on
its real facts, aﬀording complete relief to all the parties involved in the case.
1 Thus, as a matter of judicial policy, courts are impelled to treat motions for
leave to ﬁle amended pleadings with liberality, the paramount consideration
being that it does not appear that the motion for leave was with intent to
delay the proceedings. 2
This Petition for Review on Certiorari 3 under Rule 45 of the Rules of
Court assails the Decision 4 dated August 7, 2019 and the Resolution 5 dated
November 20, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 159049,
which dismissed petitioners Heirs of Pio Tejada (Pio) and Soledad Tejada's
(petitioners) Petition for Certiorari. 6 The petition dismissed by the CA
questioned the Orders dated August 17, 2018 7 and December 3, 2018 8 of
the Regional Trial Court of Virac, Catanduanes, Branch 43 (RTC) in Civil Case
No. 2471, denying petitioners' Motion for Leave and to Admit Attached
Amended Answer with Counterclaim 9 (Motion for Leave).
The present controversy ﬁnds its roots from the Complaint for Quieting
of Title 10 ﬁled by Myrna L. Hay (Myrna) against petitioners. Myrna averred
that petitioners' father, Pio, sold the disputed parcel of land to Haru Gen
Beach Resort and Hotel Corporation (Haru Gen) on November 12, 1988 as
evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale. 11 The property later found its way to
her when Haru Gen sold it on March 5, 1992 as evidenced by another Deed
of Absolute Sale. 12 Curiously, Myrna also presented another Deed of
Absolute Sale, 13 purporting to show that Pio sold the same property to her
on May 28, 1997.
Petitioners, on their own, ﬁled an Answer 14 dated August 26, 2016,
which sought for the dismissal of Myrna's Complaint on the ground that the
deeds of sale which purportedly conveyed title over the property to Myrna
was falsified, as their father's signature thereon was forged. 15
The case was initially set for pre-trial on September 28, 2016. But due
to several postponements, pre-trial ensued only on June 28, 2017. 16 On
even date, the RTC issued the Pre-Trial Order, 17 which states that the trial

was scheduled to begin on October 25, 2017. 18 However, the initial trial was
likewise postponed several times at Myrna's or her counsel's instance for
several reasons. 19 Eventually, instead of proceeding to trial, the RTC issued
an Order 20 dated June 27, 2018 referring the case to undergo mediation on
July 19, 2018.
On July 6, 2018, petitioners, through counsel this time, ﬁled a Motion
for Leave 21 for their Amended Answer to be admitted for the purpose of
"clarify[ing] several matters and [to] hasten the determination of the actual
merits of the controversy[.]" 22 Speciﬁcally, petitioners averred that the
Amended Answer: (1) speciﬁes with particularity which of the allegations in
the complaint are admitted and denied; and (2) asserts compulsory
counterclaims such as the nulliﬁcation of the deeds of absolute sale that
Myrna invoked for being falsiﬁed, declaration of petitioners' ownership over
the property, and grant of damages. 23 Petitioners argued that the admission
of the Amended Answer was warranted because there was no responsive
pleading ﬁled for the original Answer, and the case has not yet gone to trial
nor has it been called for preliminary conference. Finally, the Motion stated
that the leave sought and amendments made were not dilatory, but will aid
the court to resolve the case speedily and based on its real facts. 24
In an Order 25 dated August 17, 2018, the RTC denied the Motion for
Leave because the case had already gone through preliminary and pre-trial
conference, contrary to petitioners' claim. In addition, petitioners' counsels
were ordered to show cause why they should not be cited in contempt for
erroneously asserting that the case had not yet gone through preliminary
conference/pre-trial. 26
In compliance with the show cause order, petitioners' counsels ﬁled an
Explanation, 27 stating that their misconception regarding the stage of the
proceedings was due to the RTC Order dated June 27, 2018, which referred
the case to mediation. They averred to have believed in good faith that the
case was still on pre-trial stage since Sections II and XII, Part Three of A.M.
No. 11-1-6-SC-PHILJA, 28 otherwise known as the Consolidated and Revised
Guidelines to Implement the Expanded Coverage of Court-Annexed
Mediation and Judicial Dispute Resolution, provides that mediation
proceedings are part of the pre-trial stage. Hence, they maintained that the
amendment of the Answer remains warranted. Petitioners, through counsel,
also ﬁled a Motion for Reconsideration 29 of the denial of their Motion for
Leave, but was denied in an Order 30 dated December 3, 2018.
On grounds of grave abuse of discretion, petitioners challenged the
denial of their Motion for Leave before the CA through a Petition for
Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. 31
In a Decision 32 dated August 7, 2019, the CA found no grave abuse of
discretion on the part of the RTC in denying petitioners' Motion for Leave
considering that the records show that the case had, indeed, already gone
through the preliminary conference/pre-trial stage. Besides, according to the
CA, the Amended Answer is not necessary since all the material elements of
petitioners' defense, i.e., the deeds of absolute sale that respondent Garry B.

Hay, in substitution of Myrna (respondent), invoked were falsiﬁed, had
already been stated in their original Answer. 33 The CA disposed, thus:
WHEREFORE, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Orders dated 17
August 2018 and 3 December 2018 of the Regional Trial Court of
Virac, Catanduanes, Branch 43, in Civil Case No. 2471 are hereby
AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED. 34 (Emphasis and italics in the original)

Subsequently, petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was denied in a
Resolution 35 dated November 20, 2019. Hence, this petition.
Petitioners argue that the CA erred in aﬃrming the disallowance of the
Amended Answer because: (1) amendments to pleadings are favored at any
stage of the proceedings; (2) the Motion for Leave was filed before initial trial
and the case was still pending for mediation; and (3) the amendment was
aimed neither to delay the proceedings nor to prejudice respondent but to
clarify certain matters. 36 Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that the
allowance of the Amended Answer will only cause further delay in the
proceedings as it contains arguments already stated in the original Answer,
albeit written "in a more scholarly, formal and well[-]researched manner[.]"
37

The petition is meritorious.
It is undisputed that petitioners ﬁled their original Answer back in
August 26, 2016, and they sought its amendment only after the trial court
had concluded the pre-trial conference, wherein "[t]he necessity or
desirability of amendments to the pleadings" 38 should have been
considered. Aptly so, petitioners moved for leave of court to admit their
Amended Answer, recognizing that its ﬁling was no longer a matter of right,
but subject to the trial court's discretion. 39 In the exercise of such discretion,
trial courts may grant leave and allow the ﬁling of an amended pleading so
long as it does not appear that the motion for leave was made in bad faith or
with intent to delay the proceedings. 40
Apropos are Sections 1 41 and 3, 42 Rule 10 of the Rules of Court, which
allow amendments to pleadings "by adding [to] or striking out an x x x
inadequate allegation or description in any other respect, so that the actual
merits of the controversy may speedily be determined, without regard to
technicalities, and in the most expeditious and inexpensive manner." The
only limitation under the rules was that the leave to amend the pleading
"may be refused if it appears to the court that the motion was made with
intent to delay." Thus, "[a]s a matter of judicial policy, courts are impelled to
treat motions for leave to ﬁle amended pleadings with liberality[,]" 43
especially when such motion "is ﬁled during the early stages of [the]
proceedings or, at least, before trial." 44
In this case, the RTC, as aﬃrmed by the CA, denied the Motion for
Leave essentially because the case had already gone through
preliminary/pre-trial conference, and a Pre-Trial Order had already been
issued. The RTC ruled:
[Petitioners] claimed that this case "has not proceeded to trial

and has not even called on preliminary conference stage," hence,
"the admission of the instant amended answer is more than
warranted."
This case had not only gone through preliminary conference but
had already issued a Pre-Trial Order, which simply means that it has
gone through both preliminary and pre-trial conference, which was
actively participated in by [petitioners], through Atty. Loreto S. Ponti,
who filed a Pre-Trial Brief for [petitioners].
xxx xxx xxx
WHEREFORE, the Motion for Leave and to Admit Attached
Amended Answer with Counterclaim is, hereby, DENIED for lack of
merit.
MOREOVER, the movant-counsels, Atty. Loreto S. Ponti and
Atty. Santiago T. Gabionza, Jr., Atty. Justin James D. Francisco, are,
hereby, ORDERED to show cause, within seventy-two (72) hours from
receipt, why they should not be cited in contempt of court for lying
and misleading this Court by asserting that this case "has not even
called on (sic) preliminary conference stage" when, in fact, a Pre-Trial
Order has already been issued way back June 28, 2017.
Finally, since this case is covered by mediation, let this case
be referred to a mediator.
SO ORDERED. 45 (Emphasis and italics in the original)

Conspicuously, the RTC Orders, as well as the assailed CA Decision and
Resolution, omitted determining whether the Motion for Leave was
interposed, only to delay the proceedings. We stress that, in the furtherance
of justice, amendments to pleadings are favored and should be liberally
allowed 46 at any stage of the lawsuit 47 as long as they are not dilatory.
In the exercise of the discretion to grant or deny leave of court to admit
amended pleadings, the primordial consideration is not when the motion was
ﬁled, but rather whether the amendments sought to be admitted would aid
the court to decide the case on the merits based on real facts without
unnecessary delay, and help avoid multiplicity of suits. 48 Thus, the ﬁling of
the Motion for Leave after the issuance of the Pre-Trial Order is not reason
enough to deny it 49 and to discredit the Amended Answer as a sheer
dilatory tactic. 50 Instead, the Motion for Leave and the Amended Answer it
seeks to be admitted should be examined with circumspection, keeping in
mind the purpose of the rules in allowing amendments to pleadings, and the
general policy that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate
the attainment of justice. 51
A perusal of the Amended Answer readily shows that it speciﬁes with
particularity which of the allegations in the complaint are admitted and
denied, and it clearly sets forth the truth of the matter upon which they rely
to support any denial as required under Section 10, 52 Rule 8 of the Rules of
Court as opposed to the original Answer. Further, unlike the original Answer,
the Amended Answer speciﬁes special aﬃrmative defenses, as well as
counterclaims, to wit: the nulliﬁcation of the alleged falsiﬁed deeds of
absolute sale; and the grant of damages and attorney's fees. Under these

conditions, the admission of the Amended Answer is not only more prudent,
but in fact warranted, as it contains allegations which are crucial for the
complete and proper disposition of the case to prevent multiplicity of suits
and aﬀord relief to all parties involved in the case, and also to aid the trial
court in determining the real controversies for resolution and thereby
expedite the proceedings. 53 All of these form the very bases for the
liberality of the rules in allowing amendments to pleadings. 54 Besides, the
admission of the Amended Answer will cause no prejudice to respondent
since petitioners' defense was not substantially altered as the CA and
respondent himself pointed out. Hence, we see no basis for respondent's
accusation that the Amended Answer was interposed only to delay the
proceedings. Truth be told, respondent and counsel themselves admit that
the delay is attributable to their repeated motions to postpone the hearings
for several reasons. 55
In sum, we ﬁnd that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in denying
the Motion for Leave on the ground that the case had already gone through
preliminary/pre-trial conference. The attendant circumstances demonstrate
that the RTC had no cause to deny the leave sought for the admission of
petitioners' Amended Answer. Rather, its grant would be in keeping with the
time-honored judicial policy of favoring and aﬀording liberal treatment to
amendments to pleadings, especially those made before the conduct of
the trial 56 as in this case. In this regard, we reiterate the Court's constant
reminder:
We should always bear in mind that rules of procedure are
mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict
and rigid application especially on technical matters, which tends to
frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must be avoided.
Technicality, when it deserts its proper oﬃce as an aid to justice and
becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant
consideration from the courts. 57

ACCORDINGLY, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The
Decision dated August 7, 2019 and the Resolution dated November 20, 2019
of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 159049 are REVERSED. The
Regional Trial Court of Virac, Catanduanes, Branch 43, is DIRECTED to
admit the Amended Answer and continue with the proceedings with utmost
dispatch.
SO ORDERED.
