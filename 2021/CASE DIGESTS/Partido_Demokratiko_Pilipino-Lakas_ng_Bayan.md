# TITLE: PDP v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 225152. October 5, 2021

## PRINCIPLE:

## FACTS:

### 2015
    October 2: COMELEC issues Resolution No. 9991 prescribing guidelines for submission of SOCEs for 2016 elections, including deadline of June 8, 2016. 
### 2016
    May 9: National and local elections held
    June 8: Original deadline to file SOCEs 
    June 23: COMELEC issues Resolution No. 10147 extending deadline to June 30
    July 7: PDP-Laban files petition questioning extension of deadline

PDP-Laban argues extension exceeded COMELEC authority and violates law setting 30-day period
COMELEC argues 30-day period is extendible based on language and past practice  
OSG agrees with PDP-Laban that 30-day period is mandatory
Peralta et al. intervene, also arguing for mandatory 30-day period
Case questions whether COMELEC properly exercised its authority to extend the SOCE deadline

## ISSUE:
   - WON the COMELEC is guilty of grave abuse of discretion when it extended the deadline for the submission of Statements of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCEs)

## RULING:
The court finds that COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion when it extended the deadline for filing SOCEs and exempted candidates and political parties from administrative liabilities. This extension violates the clear language and legislative intent of the law. The court agrees with PDP-Laban and Peralta, et al. that the language of Section 14 of RA No. 7166 is unambiguous, and the required Statements of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCEs) must be filed within 30 days after the elections. The court emphasizes that the term "shall" in the statute makes the filing of SOCEs mandatory.

##### Legal standing
The court acknowledges that both PDP-Laban and Peralta, et al. have legal standing to question COMELEC Resolution No. 10147 because the legal issue involved is of transcendental importance. The matters raised in the petition and motion for intervention involve possible violations of the Constitution, specifically, the COMELEC's exercise of legislative power without proper delegation.

#####  Presumption of Constitutionality
The court refrains from discussing the constitutionality of Section 14 of RA No. 7166 in this case, as it does not constitute the core issue. The court reserves judgment on constitutional matters until the proper petition is filed between opposing parties.

#### In summary:
The COMELEC Resolution No. 10147 extending the deadline for filing SOCEs from June 8 to June 30, 2016 is declared void for violating the statutory mandate under Section 14 of RA 7166 which sets a non-extendable 30-day period. 
However, the doctrine of operative fact is applied to recognize the effects of Resolution 10147 prior to its invalidation, since candidates acted in good faith in relying on it. Therefore, SOCEs filed by June 30 are deemed timely.
While judicial restraint is exercised, the concurrence notes the constitutional issues are justiciable and the Court could have ruled on the resolution's constitutionality. 
The concurrence analyzes previous cases establishing the difference between qualifications and procedural requirements, and affirms COMELEC's authority to regulate elections procedurally. 
However, Resolution 10147 exceeded COMELEC's rule-making power by effectively modifying the substantive law under RA 7166, and cannot supplant or amend an act of Congress.
While Resolution 10147 is invalid, its effects prior to invalidation are recognized to avoid penalizing candidates who relied on it in good faith.
