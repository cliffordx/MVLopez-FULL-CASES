SECOND DIVISION
[G.R. No. 209052. June 23, 2021.]
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (Department of Education),
petitioner, vs. EULALIA T. MANEJA, respondent.

DECISION

M.V. LOPEZ, J :

Dismissal from the service imposed by the Civil Service Commission
Regional Oﬃce (CSCRO) cannot be executed pending appeal with the Civil
Service Commission Proper (CSC). Premature execution of the decision
ordering the employee's dismissal from the service entitles the employee to
the payment of backwages even though the employee is not fully
exonerated on appeal.
ANTECEDENTS
On October 29, 2001, Lyn Galarrita Cutamora (Cutamora) authorized in
writing Eulalia T. Maneja (Maneja), a Secondary School Teacher at the
Macabalan National High School in Macabalan, Cagayan de Oro City, to
process Cutamora's salary loan application with the Manila Teachers Mutual
Aid System (MTMAS), amounting to P68,000.00. Maneja processed
Cutamora's loan and a check amounting to P13,021.00, the net proceeds of
the loan, was issued. Maneja did not deliver the check to Cutamora. Instead,
she deposited it to her own account with the Oro Credit Cooperative without
Cutamora's endorsement, and afterwards appropriated the amount without
her consent. 1
Thereafter, on June 26, 2002, Cutamora ﬁled a complaint against
Maneja before the CSCRO No. 10, Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City (CSCRO No.
X), for Violation of Article 315, paragraph 1 (b), Fixing of Teacher's Loan in
any Lending Institutions like MTMAS, GSIS, etc., and Engaging in Check
Rediscounting. Later, the CSCRO No. X ﬁled a formal charge for dishonesty
against Maneja. 2
On June 25, 2003, CSCRO No. X promulgated its Decision 3 ﬁnding
Maneja guilty of dishonesty and imposing the penalty of dismissal, to wit:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, Maneja is hereby found
GUILTY as charged. Accordingly, she is meted out the penalty of
dismissal from the service with all its accessory penalties of
forfeiture of retirement beneﬁts, cancellation of eligibility and bar
from future entrance in the government service.
Let copies of this decision be furnished the Department of
Education, Regional Oﬃce No. [X], the Resident Auditor therein, the
Principal of the Macabalan National High School, the Civil Service
Field Office for Misamis Oriental.

SO ORDERED. 4 (Emphases in the original.)

Maneja's motion for reconsideration was denied on October 21, 2003 5
prompting her to ﬁle an appeal with the CSC. Meanwhile, the CSCRO No. X's
decision was implemented thereby dismissing Maneja from the service
effective December 2003. 6
Pending Maneja's appeal, on April 4, 2006, the CSC adopted Resolution
No. 06-0538 7 which classiﬁed the oﬀense of dishonesty into serious, less
serious, and simple dishonesty and provided corresponding penalties.
On June 12, 2007, the CSC issued Resolution No. 071120 8 modifying
the CSCRO No. X's decision by ﬁnding Maneja liable for the lower oﬀense of
Simple Dishonesty and imposing the penalty of three (3) months suspension,
thus:
WHEREFORE, the appeal of Eulalia T. Maneja is hereby
PARTLY GRANTED . Accordingly, the Civil Service Commission
Regional Oﬃce No. X Decision dated June 25, 2003 ﬁnding her guilty
of Dishonesty and meting on her the penalty of dismissal from the
service with all its accessory penalties is MODIFIED to the extent
that Maneja is liable for the lower oﬀense of Simple Dishonesty for
which she is hereby meted the penalty of three (3) months
suspension. 9 (Emphases in the original.)

Subsequently, Maneja ﬁled a motion for the payment of back salaries
and other emoluments due her oﬃce from the time she was dismissed from
the service with the CSCRO No. X which forwarded it to the CSC. 10 Initially,
the CSC denied Maneja's motion through Resolution No. 07-1908 dated
October 2, 2007. However, upon reconsideration, the CSC issued Resolution
No. 08-1518 dated July 24, 2008 granting Maneja's claim for backwages. The
CSC ruled that Maneja had the right to continue rendering work at the
Department of Education (DepEd) and she should not have been deprived of
her salary during the pendency of her appeal from the CSCRO No. X
Decision, thus:
WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration of Eulalia T.
Maneja is hereby GRANTED. Accordingly, she is entitled to receive
her salaries and other emoluments of her position as Secondary
School Teacher from December 2003 until her reinstatement in the
service deducting therefrom the penalty of three (3) months
suspension from the service. 11 (Emphases in the original.)

Thereafter, Maneja moved for the issuance of a writ of execution with
the CSC, which the CSC granted on March 3, 2009 through Resolution No.
090330. 12 The DepEd, represented by Division Schools SuperintendentCagayan de Oro City, Myrna S. Motoomull, ﬁled a motion for reconsideration
but was denied on April 20, 2010 in CSC Resolution No. 100788. 13
Aggrieved, the DepEd assailed the denial of its motion before the Court
of Appeals-Cagayan de Oro City (CA) through a Petition for Review under
Rule 43 of the Rules of Court docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 03637-MIN. 14 The
DepEd faulted the CSC for downgrading the charge from Dishonesty to
Simple Dishonesty and for awarding backwages to Maneja. 15

On August 29, 2013, the CA rendered its Decision 16 dismissing the
DepEd's petition for lack of merit. The CA ruled that the CSC issued
Resolution No. 06-0538 pursuant to its rule-making power provided in
Presidential Decree No. 807 17 and Executive Order No. 292 (EO No. 292); 18
thus, it did not err when it downgraded the oﬀense charged from Serious
Dishonesty to Simple Dishonesty. 19 On the grant of backwages, the CA held
that it was proper because the June 25, 2003 Decision of CSCRO No. X
ordering Maneja's dismissal was prematurely executed — it was still subject
to review by the CSC. 20
Hence, this Petition. 21 DepEd claims that CSC Resolution No. 06-0538
is invalid for expanding the singular oﬀense of Dishonesty 22 under EO No.
292. Too, the grant of backwages has no basis because Maneja was not
exonerated, she voluntarily stopped working and never reported to her
office, and she failed to file a money claim first with the Commission on Audit
(COA) for payment of backwages. 23
RULING
The petition is unmeritorious.
Foremost, we ﬁnd no error when the CA ruled that CSC Resolution No.
06-0538 was a valid exercise of the CSC's rule-making power. In Trade and
Investment Development Corporation of the Philippine v. Civil Service
Commission (TIDCO), 24 we had the occasion to discuss the rule-making
powers of the CSC, viz.:
The 1987 Constitution created the CSC as the central personnel
agency of the government mandated to establish a career service
and
promote
morale,
eﬃciency,
integrity,
responsiveness,
progressiveness, and courtesy in the civil service. It is a
constitutionally created administrative agency that possesses
executive, quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative or rule-making
powers.
While not explicitly stated, the CSC's rule-making power is
subsumed under its designation as the government's "central
personnel agency" in Section 3, Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution.
The original draft of Section 3 empowered the CSC to "promulgate
and enforce policies on personnel actions, classify positions, prescribe
conditions of employment except as to compensation and other
monetary beneﬁts which shall be provided by law." This, however,
was deleted during the constitutional commission's deliberations
because it was redundant to the CSC's nature as an administrative
agency[.]
xxx xxx xxx
The 1987 Administrative Code then spelled out the CSC's
rule-making power in concrete terms in Section 12, Book V, Title I-A
which empowered the CSC to implement the civi l service law
and other pertinent laws, and to promulgate policies,
standards and guidelines for the civil service.
The CSC's rule-making power as a constitutional grant is
an aspect of its independence as a constitutional commission.

It places the grant of this power outside the reach of Congress, which
cannot withdraw the power at any time. x x x.
xxx xxx xxx
But while the grant of the CSC's rule-making power is
untouchable by Congress, the laws that the CSC interprets and
enforces fall within the prerogative of Congress. As an
administrative agency, the CSC's quasi-legislative power is subject to
the same limitations applicable to other administrative bodies. The
rules that the CSC formulates must not override, but must be
in harmony with, the law it seeks to apply and implement. 25
(Emphases supplied and citations omitted.)

Relatively, Section 46 (b) (1), Book V, Title I-A, Chapter 7 of EO No. 292
lists Dishonesty as a ground for disciplinary action. No corresponding penalty
was prescribed for this oﬀense in the law. Hence, the CSC, as the central
personnel agency of the government, in the exercise of its rule-making
powers, is obliged to put into eﬀect this provision by providing for its proper
penalty. Accordingly, it issued Resolution No. 99-1936 or the "Uniform Rules
on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service" (URACCS), penalizing the
offense of Dishonesty with dismissal from the service in the first offense. 26
Thereafter, realizing that not all acts of dishonesty warrant the ultimate
punishment of dismissal from the service, and in light of the Court decisions
reducing the penalty of dismissal from the service to suspension, 27 the CSC
issued Resolution No. 06-0538, classifying the oﬀense of Dishonesty with the
corresponding penalties, thus:
SEC. 2.
Classiﬁcation of Dishonesty. — The classiﬁcation of
the oﬀense of Dishonesty and their corresponding penalties are as
follows:
a.

Serious Dishonesty punishable by dismissal from the
service.

b.

Less Serious Dishonesty punishable by suspension from
six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the ﬁrst
oﬀense and dismissal from the service for the second
offense.

c.

Simple Dishonesty punishable by suspension of one (1)
month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the ﬁrst
oﬀense; six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year
suspension for the second oﬀense; and dismissal from the
service for the third offense.

Evidently, CSC Resolution No. 06-0538 is in consonance with our
pronouncement in TIDCO. 28 It did not override, but is in harmony with
Section 46 (b) (1), Book V, Title I-A, Chapter 7 of EO No. 292 — the law which
the CSC seeks to enforce. Therefore, contrary to DepEd's assertion, CSC
Resolution No. 06-0538 is a valid exercise of the CSC's rule-making powers.
Moving on to Maneja's entitlement to backwages, we sustain its grant
by the CSC as affirmed by the CA.
I n Civil Service Commission v. Cruz (Cruz),


29

we explained the


conditions for backwages to be awarded when dismissal from the service
was immediately executed but the employee was later ordered reinstated
by the CSC. The government employee must not only be found innocent of
the charges; his suspension must likewise, be shown to be unjustiﬁed. Cruz
relied on the pronouncements in Bangalisan v. Hon. CA (Bangalisan), 30
Jacinto v. CA (Jacinto), 31 and De la Cruz v. Court of Appeals (Dela Cruz) 32
where the Court declared that payment of salaries corresponding to the
period when an employee is not allowed to work may be decreed if: (1) he is
found innocent of the charges which caused the suspension, and (2) when
the suspension is unjustified.
Nevertheless, we hold that the conditions laid down in Cruz do not
apply in this case. In Cruz , the penalty of dismissal from the service was
decreed by the General Manager of the City of Malolos Water District, with
the approval of its Board. In Bangalisan, the dismissal from the service of
petitioners was ordered by then Secretary of the Department of Education,
Culture and Sports. The subsequent cases of Jacinto and Dela Cruz involved
similar factual circumstances as Bangalisan. In these cases, the
immediately executed dismissal from the service were decisions of
heads of oﬃce. Under EO No. 292, decisions of Secretaries and heads of
instrumentalities imposing dismissal from the service are executory when
conﬁrmed by the Secretary concerned. 33 This is enforced by the URACCS,
the governing rules when Maneja committed her oﬀense, where the CSC
adopted the wordings of EO No. 292. 34
In this case, the dismissal from the service of Maneja was decided by
the CSCRO No. X. There is a diﬀerence in the authority who imposed the
dismissal from the service. This distinction is material because it
determines the legality of the immediate execution.
The CSC is composed of a Chairman and two Commissioners. 35 Under
the CSC's jurisdiction are the CSCROs. 36 Section 12 (11), Chapter 3, Title I-A,
Book V of EO No. 292 37 provides that the CSC has the power to review
decisions and actions of its oﬃces and agencies attached to it. The same
provision states that the CSC's decisions, orders, or rulings shall be ﬁnal and
executory. Hence, it is the CSC's decision that becomes executory, not the
CSCROs'. This does not mean that the CSCRO's decisions do not become
executory in all instances. The URACCS declare that the CSCROs' decisions
are immediately executory after 15 days from receipt of the decision, unless
a motion for reconsideration is timely filed. 38
To be sure, the URACCS distinguishes between the decisions of the
CSCROs, and the decisions of the Secretaries and heads of agencies, thus:
SEC. 5.
Jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission Proper.
—The Civil Service Commission Proper shall have jurisdiction over the
following cases:
A.

Disciplinary

1.

Decisions of Civil Service Regional Oﬃces brought
before it on petition for review;

2.


Decisions

of

heads

of

departments,

agencies,


provinces,
cities,
municipalities
and
other
instrumentalities, imposing penalties exceeding thirty
days suspension or ﬁne in an amount exceeding thirty days
salary brought before it on appeal[.] (Emphases supplied.)
xxx xxx xxx

Further, the URACCS speciﬁed that it is the decision of the heads of
oﬃces which becomes executory depending on the penalty imposed and the
filing of a motion for reconsideration or appeal, to wit:
SEC. 7.
Jurisdiction of Heads of Agencies. — Heads of
Departments, agencies, provinces, cities, municipalities and other
instrumentalities shall have original concurrent jurisdiction, with the
Commission, over their respective officers and employees.
A.

Disciplinary

1.

Complaints involving their respective personnel. Their
decisions shall be ﬁnal in case the penalty imposed is
suspension for not more than thirty days or ﬁne in an
amount not exceeding thirty (30) days salary.
Decisions of Heads of Agencies imposing a penalty
of
removal
shall
be
executory
only
after
conﬁrmation
by
the
Department
Secretary
concerned. (Emphasis supplied.)
xxx xxx xxx

SEC. 37.
Finality of Decisions. — A decision rendered by
heads of agencies whereby a penalty of suspension for not more than
thirty (30) days or a ﬁne in an amount not exceeding thirty (30) days'
salary is imposed, shall be ﬁnal and executory. However, if the
penalty imposed is suspension exceeding thirty (30) days, or ﬁne in
an amount exceeding thirty (30) days salary, the same shall be
final and executory after the lapse of the reglementary period
for ﬁling a motion for reconsideration or an appeal and no
such pleading has been filed. (Emphasis supplied.)

No similar provision, i.e., whether the penalty is removal or otherwise,
is found in the URACCS regarding the instance when the decision of the
CSCRO will be executory other than in Section 80, 39 where no motion for
reconsideration is filed.
Clearly, eﬀects of decisions of the CSCROs are diﬀerent from those of
the heads of oﬃces. Speciﬁcally, decisions of Secretaries and heads of
agencies imposing removal are executory upon conﬁrmation of the
Secretary concerned while decisions of the CSCROs imposing dismissal from
the service are executory only when no motion for reconsideration or appeal
is filed.
Applying this rule here, Maneja timely ﬁled a motion for
reconsideration of the CSCRO No. X's decision penalizing her with dismissal.
When the motion was denied, she ﬁled an appeal before the CSC within the
reglementary period. Thus, CSCRO No. X's decision never became executory.
Consequently, its implementation of Maneja's dismissal was illegal and has
no basis in law.

To reiterate, in Cruz , 40 Bangalisan, 41 Jacinto, 42 and Dela Cruz, 43 the
decisions of the disciplining authority were properly immediately executed.
In stark contrast, the decision of the CSCRO No. X here was prematurely
executed pending Maneja's appeal with the CSC. Ultimately, the conditions in
Cruz do not apply here because the decision implemented was not
executory.
We ﬁnd that the ruling in Abellera v. City of Baguio (Abellera), 44 is
applicable in this case. The CA correctly applied Abellera in aﬃrming the
grant of backwages to Maneja, viz.:
On the legal issue of respondent's entitlement to back salaries,
petitioner, citing the case of Castro v. Honorable Secretary Gloria in
his capacity as Secretary of the Department of Education, Culture and
Sports, argues that respondent is not entitled to the payment of
backwages considering that she was not completely exonerated.
Petitioner's argument would have been correct if the order of
dismissal was not prematurely executed.
The Supreme Court in Abellera v. City of Baguio, et al., had the
occasion to declare that premature execution of a decision dismissing
an employee from government service could serve as basis for an
award of back salaries.
In the said case, Abellera, a cashier in the Baguio City
Treasurer's Oﬃce, was ordered dismissed from the service after
being found guilty of dishonesty and gross negligence. Even before
the period to appeal expired, the City of Baguio dismissed him from
the service. On appeal, however, the penalty imposed on him was
reduced "to two months suspension, without pay'' although the
appealed decision was affirmed "in all other respects."
When the issue of Abellera's entitlement to back salaries
reached the Supreme Court, the High Court considered the illegality
of Abellera's suspension — i.e., from the time he was dismissed up to
the time of his actual reinstatement — to be a suﬃcient ground to
award him back salaries.
The rule on payment of back salaries during the
period of suspension of a member of the civil service who
is subsequently ordered reinstated, is already settled in
this jurisdiction. Such payment of salaries corresponding
to the period when an employee is not allowed to work
may be decreed not only if he is found innocent of the
charges which caused his suspension (Sec. 35, RA 2260),
but also when the suspension is unjustified.
In the present case, upon receipt of the [Civil
Service Commissioner's] decision x x x ﬁnding [Abellera]
guilty, but even before the period to appeal had expired,
[the Baguio City oﬃcials] dismissed [Abellera] from the
service and another one was appointed to replace him.
[Abellera's] separation x x x before the decision of
the Civil Service Commissioner had become ﬁnal
was evidently premature. [The Baguio City oﬃcials]
should have realized that [Abellera] still had the right to

appeal the Commissioner's decision to the Civil Service
Board of Appeals within a speciﬁed period, and the
possibility of that decision being reversed or modiﬁed. As
it did happen on such appeal x x x the penalty imposed
by the Commissioner was reduced x x x to only 2 months
suspension. And yet, by [the Baguio City oﬃcials'] action,
[Abellera] was deprived of work for more than 2 years.
Clearly, Ab ellera's second suspension from oﬃce
[i.e., from the time he was dismissed up to his actual
reinstatement] was unjustiﬁed, and the payment of
the salaries corresponding to said period is,
consequently, proper. (emphases and underscoring in
the original)
Here, despite the pendency of respondent's appeal with the
Commission, the June 25, 2003 Decision of the CSCRO X dismissing
him from the service was still implemented. Evidently, the execution
of the decision was premature since the same had not yet attained
ﬁnality as it was still subject to review by the Commission. As a
general rule, there can be no execution until and unless the judgment
has become final and executory.
Considering the pendency of respondent's appeal with the
Commission, prudence dictates that petitioner should not have
caused the execution of the order of dismissal. As aptly pointed out
by the Commission in its Resolution No. 08-1518 dated July 24, 2008,
viz:
The CSCRO No. X Decision dated June 25, 2003 did
not attain ﬁnality as would warrant its execution by the
DepEd. Based on the record, CSCRO No. X Decision dated
October 21, 2003 was received by Maneja on November
6, 2003. On the other hand, Maneja's Petition or appeal to
the CSCRO No. X Decision dated October 21, 2003 was
ﬁled on November 17, 2 003 before the Commission
Proper. Counting November 6 to November 17, the period
that lapsed is only eleven (11) days, thus, within the
reglementary period of ﬁfteen (15) days of ﬁling appeals
pursuant to Section 43 of the Uniform Rules on
Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, x x x.
Thus, the DepEd should not have executed the
penalty of dismissal from the service. Moreover, the
decisions of the Regional Oﬃces are not ipso facto
executory. [Emphasis supplied.] The ﬁnality of a
decision of Regional Oﬃces requires a collegial action by
the Commission Proper. Thus, in the absence of any
Resolution from the Commission declaring the ﬁnality of
the Regional Oﬃce's decision or action, the same is not
ﬁnal and executory. This is the Commission's ruling in
CSC Resolution No. 00-1240 dated May 24, 2000 x x
x[.] 45 (Emphases, italics and underscoring in the original;
citations omitted.)

Here, as in Abellera, 46 CSCRO No. X's decision was hastily executed
pending Maneja's appeal resulting in her dismissal despite the decision not

being executory. Therefore, her suspension from December 2003 up to her
actual reinstatement, is unjustiﬁed and without basis warranting the grant of
backwages covering that period, notwithstanding the fact that she was not
fully exonerated from her offense of Dishonesty.
In a last attempt to convince the Court deny backwages to Maneja, the
DepEd contends that she failed to file a money claim for backwages first with
the COA thereby amounting to non-exhaustion of administrative remedies.
This argument holds no water.
We note that DepEd belatedly raised this issue. In its petition, DepEd
claimed that the CA failed to rule on this issue which was raised in its Motion
for Reconsideration. 47 A perusal of the records reveals, however, that the
issue was not mentioned in DepEd's Motion for Reconsideration. 48 It is
settled that no question will be entertained on appeal unless it has been
raised in the proceedings below. Points of law, theories, issues and
arguments not brought to the attention of the lower court, administrative
agency or quasi-judicial body need not be considered by a reviewing court
as they cannot be raised for the ﬁrst time at that late stage. Basic
considerations of fairness and due process impel this rule. Any issue raised
for the first time on appeal is barred by estoppel. 49
At any rate, we did not require the ﬁling of money claim with the COA
when backwages were granted to reinstated government employees in Cruz ,
Bangalisan, Jacinto, and Dela Cruz. It follows that Maneja need not be
required to go through that procedure. More importantly, Maneja's claim for
backwages is not yet ﬁnal — she has no claim against the government
during the pendency of this case.
In sum, CSC Resolution No. 06-0538 does not contradict EO No. 292
and is a valid exercise of the CSC's rule-making powers. Further, Maneja's
dismissal was unjustiﬁed due to the premature execution of CSCRO No. X's
decision. Accordingly, Maneja is entitled to backwages.
FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated
August 29, 2013 of the Court of Appeals-Cagayan de Oro City in CA-G.R. SP
No. 03637-MIN is AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.
