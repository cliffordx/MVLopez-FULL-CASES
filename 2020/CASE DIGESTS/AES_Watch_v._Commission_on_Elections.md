## PRINCIPLE:
The Court emphasized that the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) should be accorded the presumption of regularity in the exercise of its discretion and the implementation of election-related policies. This principle underscores the importance of respecting the COMELEC's judgment in matters related to elections. It stressed the independent nature of the COMELEC as a constitutional body and urged that its decisions and discretion in electoral matters be respected, with judicial interference being used sparingly and only in appropriate cases. The COMELEC has the authority in choosing and implementing the Automated Election System (AES), and these decisions should be respected unless they are clearly illegal or constitute a gross abuse of discretion.

## FACTS:
- This case involves a petition for mandamus filed by AES-WATCH and others against the Commission on Elections (COMELEC).
- The petitioners seek to compel COMELEC to review the voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT), employ a different method of digitally signing the election results, and remove the prohibition on capturing devices inside polling places during elections.
- Republic Act (RA) No. 8436 in 1997 authorized COMELEC to adopt an automated election system (AES) for voting and counting votes.
- In 2007, RA No. 9369 amended RA No. 8436, allowing COMELEC to use either a paper-based or a direct recording electronic election system.
- Various concerns were raised by different groups about the implementation of AES and the use of voting machines in national elections.
- In the case of Capalla v. COMELEC, concerns were raised about the absence of digital signatures on the 2010 election results, and the court ruled that PCOS machines could produce digitally signed transmissions.
- Bagumbayan-VNP Movement, Inc. v. COMELEC sought to compel COMELEC to enable the VVPAT's voter verification feature in the 2016 National Elections.
- The court ruled that the minimum system capabilities, including VVPAT, are mandatory and distinct from physical ballots.
- COMELEC complied with the court's directive and issued guidelines for implementing the VVPAT.
- However, COMELEC prohibited the use of capturing devices inside polling places during the casting of votes.
- AES-WATCH and other petitioners argue that COMELEC has not adopted measures for VVPAT's "auditability" and proposed a solution involving capturing devices to ensure transparency.
- They also challenge the prohibition on poll watchers taking photographs of proceedings during elections and question the authenticity of electronically transmitted election results due to the absence of members' electronic signatures.

## ISSUES:
  1. Whether the prohibition on capturing devices inside polling places is constitutional.
  2. Whether the electronically transmitted election results are adequately authenticated through digital signatures.
  3. Whether poll watchers have the right to take photographs of proceedings during elections.

## RULING:
1. The Court upheld the constitutionality of the prohibition on capturing devices inside polling places during certain stages of the election process. Poll watchers are allowed to use capturing devices for specific purposes, such as taking photographs of proceedings, except during the casting of votes, to ensure the secrecy and sanctity of the ballots.

2. The Court ruled that the electronic transmission of election results, including the use of digital signatures through iButtons and PINs, is valid and compliant with jurisprudence. It considered the machine signature of the PCOS (or VCM) as the functional equivalent of a digital signature.

3. The Court confirmed that poll watchers have the right to take photographs of proceedings during elections, subject to certain restrictions. They can use capturing devices for this purpose while maintaining the secrecy of the ballots. However, the Court emphasized that capturing devices should not be used during the casting of votes to protect the secrecy of the ballots.

The Supreme Court's ruling affirmed the constitutionality of the prohibition on capturing devices in polling places, validated the authentication method for electronically transmitted results, and recognized poll watchers' right to take photographs of proceedings during elections while upholding ballot secrecy.

## DOCTRINES:

- The Court applied the mootness doctrine, stating that a case becomes moot when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy due to supervening events. In this case, the conclusion of the 2019 National Elections rendered some issues academic, and the Court declined to rule on them.

- RA 8436, as amended by R.A. No. 9369, established the use of an automated election system (AES) in the Philippines. It provided the legal framework for the conduct of automated elections, including the use of Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) machines or Vote Counting Machines (VCMs).

- The Omnibus Election Code contains provisions related to election offenses, the rights and duties of watchers, and various aspects of the electoral process in the Philippines.

## BAR Q & A:

In the 2023 National Elections, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) used the same Vote-Counting Machines (VCM) that were used in the previous elections. The VCMs were configured to print voter’s receipts, which contained the voter’s choices and a QR code. The voter’s receipts were deposited in a separate ballot box after the voter verified them. The VCMs also digitally signed the election results using the iButton security key and the personal identification number (PIN) of the members of the electoral board. The election results were then transmitted electronically to the canvassing servers.

A group of petitioners filed a petition for mandamus before the Supreme Court, seeking to compel the COMELEC to review the voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT), to employ another method of digitally signing the election results, and to remove the supposed prohibition on capturing devices while inside the polling place. The petitioners argued that:
- The VVPAT is not a mere receipt, but a paper audit trail that must be verified by an independent auditor to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the automated election system (AES).
- The digital signature generated by the VCMs is not a valid signature under the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, which requires a certificate-based digital signature issued by a duly accredited certifying authority.
- The prohibition on capturing devices violates the right of the voters to document and preserve evidence of their votes.

The COMELEC opposed the petition, contending that:
- The VVPAT is already a sufficient verification mechanism that allows the voters to check whether their votes are registered correctly by the VCMs.
- The digital signature produced by the VCMs complies with the law and jurisprudence, which recognize that any distinctive mark, characteristic, or sound in electronic form, representing the identity of a person and attached to or logically associated with an electronic document, may be used as a digital signature.
- The prohibition on capturing devices is a reasonable measure to protect the secrecy and sanctity of the ballot, and to prevent vote-buying and other election offenses.

How would you decide the petition? Explain your answer.

**SUGGESTED ANSWER**

I would deny the petition for mandamus for lack of merit.

The VVPAT is not a paper audit trail that requires an independent audit, but a voter verification feature that enables the voters to confirm whether their votes are recorded correctly by the VCMs. The law does not mandate that the VVPAT be subjected to an audit by an independent auditor. Moreover, there are other safeguards in place to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the AES, such as random manual audit, source code review, and election returns verification,

The digital signature generated by the VCMs is a valid signature under the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, which defines an electronic signature as any distinctive mark, characteristic, or sound in electronic form, representing the identity of a person and attached to or logically associated with an electronic document. The iButton security key and PIN of the members of the electoral board are distinctive marks that represent their identity and are logically associated with the election results transmitted by the VCMs. The law does not require that an electronic signature be certificate-based or issued by a certifying authority.

The prohibition on capturing devices is a reasonable measure to protect the secrecy and sanctity of the ballot, and to prevent vote-buying and other election offenses. The law prohibits any person from bringing any camera or cellular phone inside a polling place or taking photographs or videos inside it. The law also prohibits any person from showing his or her ballot or informing anyone of its contents after it has been filled out. These prohibitions are intended to prevent any undue influence or coercion on voters, and to preserve their freedom of choice.
