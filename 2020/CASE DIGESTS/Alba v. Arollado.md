## PRINCIPLE:

Actions based upon an oral contract must be commenced within 6 years. (Art. 1145)
The time for prescription for all kinds of actions, when there is no special provision which ordains otherwise, shall be counted from the day they may be brought.(Art. 1150)
The prescription of actions is interrupted when they are filed before the court, when there is a written extrajudicial demand by the creditors, and when there is any written acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor. (Art. 1155)

## FACTS:

Regina Q. Alba (Regina) sells crude oil and other petroleum products to Nida Arollado (Nida) on credit.
On three different dates (July 26, November 12 and November 27, 2000) Nida issued three checks to pay for some of the purchases, but the checks were dishonored by the bank.

On May 15, 2013, Regina sends a written demand letter to Nida demanding payment of the outstanding debt but Nida did not pay.

Regina filed a complaint against Nida on June 4, 2013, seeking payment for the outstanding balance.
Nida claimed that she had already settled the debt through installment payments and that Regina's right to collect had already prescribed.

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of Regina and ordered Nida to pay Regina the value of the dishonored checks, plus attorney's fees and litigation expenses. However, the Court of Appeals (CA) reverses the RTC's decision and ruled that Regina's action has already prescribed.

## ISSUE:

Whether the parties entered into a written or oral contract.
Whether the prescriptive period began for Regina's action to collect the debt.
Whether Nida's partial payments interrupted the prescriptive period.
Whether Regina's demand letter interrupted the prescriptive period.


## RULING:


The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision that Regina's action was time-barred.
The sale was considered an oral contract because there was no formal written agreement.
The six-year prescriptive period started from the date of dishonor of the checks in 2000 and 2003.
Regina's demand letter in May 2013 did not interrupt the prescription period because it was not written.

The Supreme Court ruled that Regina's action against Nida was time-barred because it was filed after the six-year prescriptive period for oral contracts. Article 1145 of the Civil Code states that the prescriptive period for actions based on oral contracts is six years. The Court also relied on Article 1150 of the Civil Code which provides that the prescriptive period starts from the day the action could have been brought. Since Regina filed the lawsuit more than six years after the checks were dishonored, her action was time-barred. The Court rejected Regina's argument that Nida's partial payments interrupted the prescription period because there was no evidence of a written acknowledgment of the debt.

## DOCTRINES:

The dishonor of a check creates a debt due and demandable from the drawer to the payee. This means that Regina had the right to sue Nida for the amount of the checks as soon as they were dishonored.
Actions based upon an oral contract must be commenced within 6 years. (Art. 1145)

## BAR Q & A:

On January 1, 2018, Peter lent to Maya ₱100,000.00, payable on demand. On January 1, 2019, Peter made a written demand for payment, but Maya refused to pay. Peter did not file a lawsuit against Maya until February 1, 2024. Did Peter's right to demand payment from Maya has prescribed?

### Suggested Answer:

Yes, Peter's right to demand payment from Maya has prescribed. The Civil Code provides that actions based upon an oral contract must be commenced within 6 years. In this case, Peter's action is based on a loan agreement, which is not considered a special provision under the Civil Code hence, the general prescriptive period of six years applies. Peter's written demand on January 1, 2019 interrupted the prescriptive period. However, prescription resumes after the interruption ceases. Since Peter did not file a lawsuit until Ferburary 1, 2024, more than six years have passed since the interruption ceased, the prescriptive period has already lapsed.
