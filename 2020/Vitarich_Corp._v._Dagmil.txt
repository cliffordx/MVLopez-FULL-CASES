FIRST DIVISION
[G.R. No. 217138. August 27, 2020.]
VITARICH CORPORATION , petitioner, vs. FEMINA R. DAGMIL,
respondent.

DECISION

M. V. LOPEZ, J :

The propriety of an order of default is the core issue in this Petition for
Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Court
of Appeals' (CA) Decision 1 dated October 31, 2014 in CA-G.R. SP No.
131472, which set aside the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Decision dated April
1, 2011 in Civil Case No. 33-M-2010.
ANTECEDENTS
On January 15, 2010, Vitarich Corporation ﬁled an action for sum of
money against Femina Dagmil before the RTC Branch 11 of Malolos City
docketed as Civil Case No. 33-M-2010. 2 Upon receipt of summons, Femina's
counsel, Atty. Nepthali Solilapsi, moved to dismiss the case on ground of
improper venue. 3 On August 17, 2010, the RTC denied the motion and
directed Femina to answer the complaint. 4 Atty. Solilapsi received the Order
on November 3, 2010 but Femina did not submit any responsive pleading. 5
On January 5, 2011, Vitarich sought to declare Femina in default. 6
Meantime, Femina's new counsel, Atty. Emilio Quianzon, Jr., entered his
appearance and filed on January 31, 2011 a motion to admit answer. 7
On February 8, 2011, the RTC declared Femina in default and allowed
Vitarich to present its evidence ex-parte. Meanwhile, on March 1, 2011, the
RTC denied Atty. Quianzon, Jr.'s entry of appearance and Femina's motion to
admit answer. 8 On April 1, 2011, the RTC granted the complaint and ordered
Femina to pay Vitarich the following amounts, 9 to wit:
1.

The amount of FIFTEEN MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY NINE
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY PESOS (P15,829,840.00)
representing the principal obligation plus interest at the rate of
twenty four (24%) per annum from the filing of the complaint.

2.

To pay the plaintiﬀ the amount of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos
(P200,000.00) as and for attorney's fees and;

3.

To pay the cost of suit. 10

Aggrieved, Femina ﬁled a petition for relief 11 from judgment based on
her former counsel's excusable negligence. Allegedly, Atty. Solilapsi failed to
timely read the order directing her to ﬁle an answer because his secretary
placed it on a wrong case folder. Moreover, Atty. Solilapsi was saddled with
health issues and seldom reported to his oﬃce that made it diﬃcult for her

to correspond with him. Femina also ﬁled a motion for new trial 12 claiming
mistake and/or excusable negligence and that she has a meritorious
defense.
On June 7, 2012, the RTC denied the motion for new trial emphasizing
that Femina is bound by the action of her counsel. 13 Dissatisﬁed, Femina
ﬁled motions for reconsideration and to resolve the petition for relief from
judgment. On May 20, 2013, the RTC denied the motions, viz.:
[T]his Court, after a careful review of the records, is of the view and
so holds that the points raised therein, have been passed upon in the
resolution of denial, hence, for lack of any compelling ground to
warrant a modiﬁcation or reversal thereof, the instant motion is
hereby DENIED.
Concerning herein defendants['] petition for relief, it is noted
that the said petition is basically anchored upon similar grounds as
her motion for new trial which, needless to state, have been dealt
with extensively in the Order of June 7, 2012, hence, on that basis
alone, the Court hereby ﬁnds no meritorious reason to give due
course.
Neither can the Court grant defendants' prayer to appeal the
default judgment in view of plaintiﬀs' opposition, defendant having
failed to appeal the decision within the reglementary period.
SO ORDERED. 14

Femina ﬁled a petition for certiorari 15 before the CA, docketed as CAG.R. SP No.
131472, faulting the RTC with grave abuse of discretion. On
October 31, 2014, the CA reversed the April 1, 2011 judgment of default and
remanded the case for further proceedings. It also ordered the RTC to admit
Femina's answer, 16 thus:
The Court ﬁnds that the trial court gravely abused its discretion
in rendering judgment by default, despite the several remedies
resorted to by petitioner in order for her to be given her day in court.
There is no denying that petitioner availed of the following remedies:
(I)

"Entry of Appearance and Motion to Admit Answer[;"]

(II)

Petition for Relief of the Orders dated February 8, 2011
and March 1, 2011;

(III)

Motion for New Trial of the Decision dated April 1, 2011;
and

(IV)

Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated June 7,
2012 denying petitioner's motion for new trial.

By availing of the foregoing remedies, petitioner had
manifested a strong desire to ﬁle an answer to prove her defense
which should not have been disregarded by the trial court. It must
also be stressed that when petitioner ﬁled her motion to admit
answer on January 31, 2011, the trial court had not yet declared her
in default. The Order of default was issued on February 8, 2011. x x x


xxx xxx xxx
Thus, it would be in keeping with justice and equity to allow

petitioner's prayer for new trial in order for her to present her
evidence; and for the trial court to determine with certainty whether
the computation presented by private respondent reﬂects the true
and real obligation of petitioner. 17

Hence, this petition. Vitarich argued that there is no proof that Femina
ﬁled her motion to admit answer before the RTC declared her in default.
Further, the health issues of Atty. Solilapsi and the mistake of his secretary
do not constitute excusable negligence. 18
RULING
The petition is unmeritorious.
We have enunciated in Sablas v. Sablas 19 the principle that it is within
the sound discretion of the trial court to permit the defendant to ﬁle his
answer and to be heard on the merits even after the reglementary period for
ﬁling the responsive pleading expires. The rule is that the answer should be
admitted when it is ﬁled before a declaration of default provided there is no
showing that defendant intends to delay the proceedings and no prejudice is
caused to the plaintiff. 20
I n Sablas, the petitioners ﬁled a motion for extension of time to ﬁle
their answer. But, they were able to ﬁle a responsive pleading three days
late from the expiration of the requested period. While the answer was ﬁled
out of time, the trial court admitted the pleading because no motion to
declare the petitioners in default was ﬁled. Corollarily, the trial court denied
the respondents' subsequent motion to declare the petitioners in default.
The Court of Appeals then reversed the trial court's ruling and remanded the
case for reception of plaintiﬀs' evidence. However, this Court held that the
CA erred in ruling that the trial court had no recourse but to declare
petitioners in default when they failed to ﬁle their answer within the
requested period, thus:
The rule is that the defendant's answer should be
admitted where it is ﬁled before a declaration of default and
no prejudice is caused to the plaintiﬀ. Where the answer is ﬁled
beyond the reglementary period but before the defendant is declared
in default and there is no showing that defendant intends to
delay the case, the answer should be admitted.
Therefore, the trial court correctly admitted the answer of
petitioner spouses even if it was ﬁled out of time because, at the time
of its ﬁling, they were not yet declared in default nor was a motion to
declare them in default ever ﬁled. Neither was there a showing that
petitioner spouses intended to delay the case.
xxx xxx xxx
Since the trial court already admitted the answer, it was
correct in denying the subsequent motion of respondents to
declare petitioner spouses in default. 21 (Emphasis supplied;
citations omitted.)

I n Sablas, we cited Indiana Aerospace University v. Comm. on Higher
Educ. 22 which set aside an order of default. In that case, the petitioner

sought to declare the respondent in default. On the same date, the
respondent moved for an extension of time to ﬁle an answer. Yet, the trial
court still issued an order of default even if the respondent submitted a
responsive pleading within the requested period. We ruled that the trial
court committed grave abuse of discretion because placing the respondent
in default served no practical purpose, thus:
Petitioner claims that in issuing the default Order, the RTC did
not act with grave abuse of discretion, because respondent had failed
to ﬁle its answer within ﬁfteen days after receiving the August 14,
1998 Order.
We disagree. Quite the contrary, the trial court gravely
abused its discretion when it declared respondent in default
despite the latter's ﬁling of an Answer. Placing respondent in
default thereafter served no practical purpose.
Petitioner was lax in calling the attention of the Court to the
ﬁfteen-day period for ﬁling an answer. It moved to declare
respondent in default only on September 20, 1998, when the ﬁling
period had expired on August 30, 1998. The only conclusion in this
case is that petitioner has not been prejudiced by the delay. The
same leniency can also be accorded to the RTC, which declared
respondent in default only on December 9, 1998, or twenty-two days
after the latter had ﬁled its Answer on November 17, 1998.
Defendant's Answer should be admitted, because it had been
ﬁled before it was declared in default, and no prejudice was
caused to plaintiff. x x x 23 (Emphases supplied; citations omitted.)

In Hernandez v. Agoncillo, 24 however, we clariﬁed the ruling in Sablas
and held that it is not mandatory on the part of the trial court to admit an
answer which is belatedly ﬁled even though the defendant is not yet
declared in default. Settled is the rule that it is within the discretion of the
trial court to permit the ﬁling of an answer even beyond the reglementary
period, provided that there is justiﬁcation for the belated action and there is
no showing that the defendant intended to delay the proceedings. 25 In that
case, we found the petitioner guilty of inexcusable neglect and deliberately
employing delay in the prosecution of the civil case against him. Also, we
noted signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the Sablas and Hernandez cases, to
wit:
The Court ﬁnds no cogent reason to depart from the above
ruling of the MeTC, as affirmed by the RTC and the CA.


Sablas diﬀers from the instant case on two aspects, to wit: first,
i n Sablas, the petitioners' motion for extension to ﬁle their answer
was seasonably ﬁled while in the present case, petitioner's Motion for
Extension to File His Answer was ﬁled beyond the 15-day period
allowed by the Rules of Court; second, in Sablas, since the trial court
admitted the petitioners' Answer, this Court held that the trial court
was correct in denying the subsequent motion of the respondent to
declare the petitioners in default while, in the instant case, the MeTC
denied due course to petitioner's Answer on the ground that the
Motion for Extension was not seasonably ﬁled and that the Answer
was ﬁled beyond the period requested in the Motion for Extension,

thus, justifying the order of default. Thus, the principle enunciated in
Sablas is not applicable in the present case.
In this respect, the Court agrees with the CA in its ruling that
procedural rules are not to be ignored or disdained at will to suit the
convenience of a party. 26

Given these precepts, we ﬁnd that the CA correctly reversed the
judgment of default. Foremost, Femina moved to admit her answer before
she was declared in default. Femina ﬁled her motion through registered mail
on January 31, 2011 while the order of default was issued on February 8,
2011. The fact of mailing on the said date is undisputed. It was mentioned in
the RTC and CA's ﬁndings and admitted in the parties' pleadings. Notably,
Section 3, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court provides that if a pleading is ﬁled by
registered mail, then the date of mailing shall be considered as the date of
ﬁling. It does not matter when the court actually receives the mailed
pleading. 27 Thus, this circumstance must be fully appreciated in favor of
Femina. Applying the Sablas ruling, the RTC should have considered
Femina's answer since it was filed before the declaration of default.
Moreover, persuasive reasons justiﬁed the belated ﬁling of the motion
to admit answer. 28 The records reveal that Atty. Solilapsi had been conﬁned
in the hospital twice in January 2011. He was treated for Pulmonary
Tuberculosis Class 3 (Intensive Phase) and was advised to take a rest for two
months. 29 This caused Atty. Solilapsi to be absent from oﬃce most of the
time and to ask for his discharge as counsel. The delay was compounded by
the mistake of Atty. Solilapsi's secretary who placed the order to ﬁle answer
in the wrong case folder. These predicaments forced Femina to hire a new
counsel to defend her case. Further, Femina's answer shows that she has a
prima facie meritorious defense. The allegations that Femina did not receive
several deliveries and that Vitarich money claims of P15,829,840.00 were
bloated must be determined in a full-blown trial. The outcome of the case,
after all, will still depend on the strength of the parties' respective evidence.
Applying the Hernandez ruling, the RTC should have liberally exercised its
discretion and permitted the ﬁling of an answer even beyond the
reglementary period.
To be sure, there is no showing that Femina intended to delay the
proceedings. As the CA aptly held, Femina availed several post-judgment
remedies which evinced her desire to ﬁle an answer and to establish her
defenses. More importantly, Vitarich did not suﬀer any damage. It appears
that Femina's counsel received on November 3, 2010 the notice to ﬁle
answer and had 15 days or until November 18, 2010 to comply. Yet, Vitarich
moved to declare Femina in default only on January 5, 2011 or 48 days from
the expiration of the reglementary period. The only conclusion is that
Vitarich has not been prejudiced by the delay. Otherwise, Vitarich would not
have been lenient and opted to wait that long before invoking its right.
Taken together, we aﬃrm the CA's ﬁndings that the RTC gravely
abused its discretion in rendering the judgment of default. The RTC could
have rectiﬁed the palpable error by lifting the order of default, admitting
Femina's answer and considering it in deciding the case. Applying the

Indiana Aerospace University ruling, declaring the defendant in default after
the ﬁling of answer served no practical purpose. However, the RTC
unceremoniously discarded the compelling circumstances resulting in a
violation of Femina's right to present evidence on her behalf. Consequently,
the premature and improvident order of default and judgment of default are
void. It is the avowed policy of the law to accord both parties every
opportunity to pursue and defend their cases in the open and relegate
technicality to the background in the interest of substantial justice. 30 On this
point, we reiterate the ruling in Akut v. CA, 31 that courts should be liberal in
setting aside orders of default, for default judgments are frowned upon,
thus:


The controlling principle ignored by respondent court is that it
is within sound judicial discretion to set aside an order of default and
to permit a defendant to ﬁle his answer and to be heard on the merits
even after the reglementary period for the ﬁling of the answer has
expired. This discretion should lean towards giving partylitigants every opportunity
to properly present their
conﬂicting claims on the merits of the controversy without
resorting to technicalities. Courts should be liberal in setting
aside orders of default, for default judgments are frowned
upon, and unless it clearly appears that reopening of the case is
intended for delay, it is best that the trial courts give both parties
every chance to ﬁght their case fairly and in the open, without resort
to technicality. x x x
x x x Moreover, petitioners' answer shows that they have a
prima facie meritorious defense. They should, therefore, be given
their day in court to avoid the danger of committing a grave
injustice if they were denied an opportunity to introduce
evidence in their behalf. 32 (Emphases supplied; citation omitted.)

In sum, while there are instances when a party may be properly
declared in default, these cases should be deemed exceptions to the rule
and should be resorted to only in clear cases of obstinate refusal or
inordinate neglect in complying with the orders of the court. 33 Otherwise,
any judgment by default that the trial court may subsequently render is
intrinsically void for having been rendered pursuant to a patently invalid
order of default. 34
FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeal's
Decision dated October 31, 2014 in CA-G.R. SP No. 131472 is AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.
