DECISION

M. V. LOPEZ, J :

This Petition for Review on Certiorari 1 ﬁled under Rule 45 of the Rules
of Court seeks to set aside the Decision dated March 20, 2018 2 of the Court
of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 147131. The CA reversed the Decision No.
160324 3 dated February 29, 2016 and Resolution No. 1600574 4 dated June
6, 2016 of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), and exonerated Hilario J.
Dampilag of two counts of serious dishonesty.


Facts
On November 27, 2014, an anonymous complaint 5 was ﬁled before the
Examination Services Division of the CSC-Cordillera Administrative Region
(CSC-CAR) alleging that Dampilag committed an examination irregularity. 6
Acting on the complaint, the CSC-CAR requested from the CSC Field
Oﬃce-Baguio City a copy of Dampilag's Personal Data Sheet (PDS). 7 The
PDS 8 accomplished on March 3, 1999 showed that Dampilag passed the
Career Service Professional Examination (CSPE) held in Baguio City on
December 1, 1996 with a rating of 81.89. 9 However, the CSC-CAR noted
glaring disparities as to Dampilag's facial features and signatures in the
Picture Seat Plan 10 (PSP) for the December 1, 1996 CSPE with those of
Dampilag's PDS. Thus, in an Order dated December 2, 2014, the CSC-CAR
directed Dampilag to comment to its ﬁndings. 11 Dampilag submitted his
Affidavit of Explanation on February 5, 2015. 12
After preliminary investigation, the CSC-CAR issued Resolution No. 1500007 charging
Dampilag with Serious Dishonesty, Falsiﬁcation of Oﬃcial
Documents, and Grave Misconduct. 13 In the resolution, Dampilag was
accused of allowing somebody to apply and take in his behalf the CSPE held
on December 1, 1996 in Baguio City and reﬂected the result in his PDS,
thereby misleading the appointing authority to appoint him as Special
Investigator I of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-CAR
(DENR-CAR), and the CSC to approve his appointment. 14
In his Answer, Dampilag admitted that he was not the person in the
picture pasted in the PSP but his former board mate, a certain Bong Martin.
15 He explained that on the day of the examination, he had in his possession
an improvised envelope containing his and Bong's photos. 16 Pressed for
time, he indiscriminately brought out the photographs, aﬃxed his signature
at the back of one of the photos, and submitted it to the exam proctor

without verifying the actual photograph submitted. 17 As to the alleged
variation in the signatures in the PDS and PSP, Dampilag claimed that the
two signatures have notable similarities, and that any perceived disparities
were accepted norm because of the considerable lapse of time from the date
of examination to the accomplishment of the PDS. 18 In all, Dampilag argued
lack of evidence of bad faith and lack of intent to mislead the appointing
authority. 19
In lieu of the scheduled pre-hearing conference and formal hearing, the
CSC-CAR allowed Dampilag to submit his position paper. 20 In his position
paper, Dampilag insisted that the handwriting and signature style appearing
in the PDS and PSP were his own. 21 He submitted additional documents
bearing his signature and executed on diﬀerent dates to prove his varying
signatures and handwriting over the years. 22
On September 11, 2015, the CSC-CAR issued Decision No. 15-0058
ﬁnding Dampilag guilty of the oﬀenses charged and imposed upon him the
penalty of dismissal from the service. 23
The CSC-CAR noted that the features of the person in the photograph
pasted over the name Hilario J. Dampilag in the PSP were not similar with the
features of Dampilag in the photograph pasted in his PDS accomplished on
March 3, 1999. The CSC-CAR did not consider Dampilag's defense that it was
pure inadvertence when he gave the picture of his former board mate
instead of his own during the examination. The CSC-CAR was convinced that
room examiners will not let any person take the examination if he did not
look like the person in the picture submitted. Further, a comparison of the
signature of Dampilag in the PDS against the signature of the purported
examinee Hilario J. Dampilag in the PSP revealed immense disparities. The
CSC-CAR concluded that another person took the CSPE for and in behalf of
Dampilag. Since the prescribed forms for government examinations, such as
the PSP and the PDS, once duly accomplished are considered oﬃcial
documents, by intentionally making false narration of material facts in these
documents, Dampilag committed Serious Dishonesty, Falsiﬁcation of Oﬃcial
Documents, and Grave Misconduct.
Dampilag's motion for reconsideration was denied by the CSC-CAR in
its Resolution No. 15-00023 dated October 28, 2015. 24
Aggrieved, Dampilag ﬁled his appeal memorandum to the CSC,
reiterating that his submission of a diﬀerent photograph was due to pure
inadvertence and may be considered as excusable negligence. 25 He insisted
that the alleged discrepancies between the signatures in the PSP and the
PDS were not substantial and any slight variation was an accepted norm
because handwriting and signatures of a person vary over time. 26
On February 29, 2016, the CSC aﬃrmed the ﬁndings of the CSC-CAR
but found Dampilag guilty instead of two counts of serious dishonesty. 27
The CSC found the dissimilarities and disparities in the photographs
and signatures in the PSP and the PDS suﬃcient to conclude that another
person took the examination for and in behalf of Dampilag. Further,
Dampilag committed falsiﬁcation of oﬃcial document when he intentionally

and consciously misrepresented in his PDS that he was a CSPE passer, and
allowed another person to take the examination and sign in the PSP as him.
However, the CSC modiﬁed the decision of the CSC-CAR and found
Dampilag liable instead for two counts of Serious Dishonesty pursuant to
Section 3 28 of CSC Resolution No. 06-0538 29 dated April 4, 2006. The CSC
ruled that Dampilag: (1) committed examination irregularity of
impersonation by conniving and colluding with somebody to take the
December 1, 1996 CSPE, and (2) employed fraud and falsiﬁcation of oﬃcial
document by stating in his PDS dated March 3, 1999 that he passed the
December 1, 1996 CSPE when he did not.
The dispositive portion of the February 29, 2016 decision reads: 30
WHEREFORE, the petition for review of Hilario J. Dampilag
Special Investigator I, City Environment and Natural Resources Oﬃce
(CENRO), [DENR-CAR], Baguio City, is hereby DISMISSED.
Accordingly, the Decision No. 15-0058 dated September 11, 2015 and
Resolution No. 15-00023 dated October 28, 2015 of the [CSC-CAR],
Baguio City, ﬁnding him guilty of Serious Dishonesty, Falsiﬁcation of
Oﬃcial Documents, and Grave Misconduct and imposing upon him
the penalty of dismissal from the service with all the accessory
penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits,
except terminal/accrued leave beneﬁts and personal contributions to
the GSIS if any, perpetual disqualiﬁcation from holding public oﬃce
and bar from taking civil service examinations; and denying his
Motion for Reconsideration, respectively, are hereby MODIFIED as he
is found GUILTY of two (2) counts of Serious Dishonesty and imposed
upon him the penalty of dismissal from the service with all the
accessory penalties aforestated.
Copies of this Decision shall be furnished the Commission on
Audit-DENR-CAR and the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS), for their reference and appropriate action.
Quezon City. 31

On reconsideration, Dampilag averred that the CSC failed to consider
certain documents showing varying style of his signature and handwriting. 32
He insisted that he inadvertently submitted the wrong picture and the act
was not attended by malice. 33
On June 6, 2016, the CSC denied the motion and ruled:
WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration of Hilario J.
Dampilag, Special Investigator I, [CENRO], [DENR-CAR] is hereby
DENIED. Accordingly, CSC Decision No. 160324 dated February 29,
2016 which modiﬁed the Decision No. 15-0058 dated September 11,
2015 and Resolution No. 15-00023 dated October 28, 2015 of the
[CSC-CAR], Baguio City, ﬁnding him guilty of two (2) counts of Serious
Dishonesty and imposing upon him the penalty of dismissal from the
service with all the accessory penalties of cancellation of eligibility,
forfeiture of retirement beneﬁts, except terminal/accrued leave
beneﬁts and personal contribution to the GSIS, if any, perpetual
disqualiﬁcation from holding public oﬃce, and bar from taking Civil
Service Examination, STANDS.

Quezon City. 34

On appeal, the CA reversed the CSC and exonerated Dampilag of the
oﬀense. The CA noted that a copy of the PSP and PDS were not made part of
the records of the CA. 35 With the absence of possible reference to ﬁnd the
existence of the alleged dissimilarities between the photograph and the
signature in the PSP and PDS, the CA based its decision solely on the pieces
of evidence submitted before it (i.e., Aﬃdavit of Mandy Doney, executed on
January 9, 2002; Certiﬁcation issued by the DENR-CAR, Land Management
Services, executed on November 29, 2008; Certiﬁcation of Land
Investigation issued by the DENR-CAR, Land Management Services, executed
on February 11, 2009; Certiﬁcation pertaining to a free patent application,
executed on October 8, 2013; Joint Aﬃdavit in support of free patent
application, executed on August 11, 1999). 36 Based on these documents,
the CA concluded that Dampilag's signature indeed exhibited minor
deviations from the manner in which he had aﬃxed his signature in the past.
37 Accordingly, the CA exonerated Dampilag, viz.: 38
x x x, [Dampilag] has consistently contested the ﬁndings of the
CSC-CAR and CSC regarding the perceived diﬀerences in his
signature all throughout its proceedings. And while We would
generally aﬀord weight to these ﬁndings, in the absence of
substantial evidence in support thereof and in light of the questions
of fact raised by [Dampilag] in the instant petition. We deem it
prudent to consider the evidence on record in which this Decision is
based, and rule in favor of exonerating him for the offense charged.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant Petition is
hereby GRANTED. The assailed Decision and Resolution of the CSC
dated February 29, 2016 and June 6, 2016 are REVERSED and SET
ASIDE. Accordingly, the petitioner Hilario J. Dampilag is
EXONERATED of the offense charged.
SO ORDERED. 39

Hence, the CSC, through the Oﬃce of the Solicitor General (OSG), ﬁled
the instant petition before this Court. 40
The OSG avers that the CA erroneously reversed the decision of the
CSC despite being supported by substantial evidence. A comparison of the
PDS and PSP showed glaring disparities as to Dampilag's signature that even
a layman, using his naked eye, can readily see.
In compliance with this Court's Resolution 41 dated July 9, 2018,
Dampilag filed his comment 42 on November 7, 2018.
Dampilag counters that there are no substantial discrepancies between
his handwriting and signature in the PDS and in the PSP. He posits that he
has the tendency of constantly changing the style of his signature as year
passes by. This was supported by various documents that he submitted
before the CA. Further, the CSC's conclusion that another person took the
CSPE for and in his behalf is not supported by substantial evidence, but
mere conjectures and speculations considering that no handwriting expert
was presented to render his opinion on the matter. As to the photograph in
the PSP, Dampilag already explained that he inadvertently submitted the

picture of his former board mate which was mixed with his in an improvised
envelope that he had in his possession on the day of examination. The
circumstances do not indicate malice to commit fraud on his part and can be
considered as excusable negligence.
In its Reply, 43 the OSG avers that the submission of a diﬀerent
photograph in an examination cannot be considered as excusable
negligence. As a matter of procedure, room examiners closely examine the
pictures submitted and attached on the PSP, and compare the appearance of
each of the examinees with the person in the picture submitted and aﬃxed
on the PSP. Further, the CSC examiners enjoy a presumption of regularity in
the administration of civil service examinations. The OSG insists the stark
diﬀerences between the handwriting and signatures of Dampilag in the PSP
and in the PDS.


Ruling
Prefatorily, ﬁndings of facts of administrative agencies, such as the
CSC, if based on substantial evidence, are controlling on the reviewing court.
The CSC are better equipped in handling cases involving the employment
status of employees in the Civil Service since it is within the ﬁeld of their
expertise. 44 Moreover, it is not the function of the Supreme Court in a Rule
45 petition to analyze and weigh all over again the evidence presented
before the lower court, tribunal or oﬃce. One of the recognized exceptions
to this rule is when the ﬁndings of the CA are contrary to those of the lower
court, tribunal or office, as in this case.
The CA exonerated Dampilag on the basis of absence of evidence on
the records that will support the CSC's conclusion that there exists
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the signatures of Dampilag in the PSP and in
the PDS. According to the CA, since a copy of the PSP and the PDS were not
made part of the records, "the alleged diﬀerences remain a mystery to th[e]
[c]ourt." 45 Thus, the CA decided on Dampilag's guilt based on the evidence
presented before it — the several aﬃdavits and certiﬁcations which bore
Dampilag's signature and executed over diﬀerent dates. After careful
examination, the CA concluded that Dampilag's signatures indeed vary over
time.
In this petition, the CSC implores this Court to reverse the CA because
the charges against Dampilag are well substantiated by evidence.
We rule in favor of the CSC.
The evidence on record is overwhelming to support the ﬁnding of the
CSC that Dampilag employed another person to take the December 1, 1996
CSPE held in Baguio City for and in his behalf and claimed the result as his
own in his PDS accomplished on March 3, 1999. We are one with the CSC
that the diﬀerences in the facial features of the person appearing on the PSP
vis-à-vis the PDS are evident in the shapes of the face, nose, lips and eyes of
Dampilag. To be sure, Dampilag admitted that the person in the picture
pasted in the PSP is not him. We ﬁnd it, however, improbable that it was due
to mere inadvertence that Dampilag gave the picture of his former board
mate instead of his own picture during the day of examination. The CSC

oﬃcials who supervise civil service examinations enjoy the presumption of
regularity in the performance of their oﬃcial duties. 46 If only to stress, we
quote the findings of the CSC:
The lame justiﬁcation of Dampilag cannot prevail over the
overwhelming documentary evidence of the prosecution as regards
the discrepancies in the facial features of the pictures attached to the
subject PSP and his PDS dated March [3], 1999. It should be stressed
that as a matter of procedure, the room examiners assigned to
supervise the conduct of a civil service examination closely examine
the pictures submitted and aﬃxed on the PSP. The legal presumption
that exists under the Civil Service Law and Rules is that the person
whose picture appears in the PSP is the person who took the
examination. The CSC oﬃcials who conducted the examination and
ensured that it is the actual examinee's picture which is attached in
the PSP are presumed to be regularly performing their duties and
strong evidence is necessary to rebut this presumption.
In cases where the examinee does not look like the person in
the picture submitted and attached to the PSP, the examiner will not
allow said examinee to take the examination. Surely, Dampilag's
impersonator was allowed by the Room and Supervising Examiners to
take the examination because he pasted his own picture in the PSP.
On the contrary, had the impersonator pasted in the PSP the true
picture of Dampilag, he would have been disallowed by the
examiners to take the examination. 47

Dampilag failed to controvert the presumption of regularity in the
performance of duties of the room examiners. Thus, the CSC examiners are
conclusively deemed to have regularly performed their duties in relation to
the administration of the CSPE held in Baguio City on December 1, 1996. 48
As to the absence of a handwriting expert, Section 49,49 Rule 130 of
the Rules of Court uses the word "may," which signiﬁes that the use of
opinion of expert witness is permissive and not mandatory. 50 In Heirs of
Severa P. Gregorio v. Court of Appeals , 51 we held that due to the
technicality of the procedure involved in the examination of the forged
documents, the expertise of questioned document examiners is usually
helpful; however, resort to questioned document examiners is not
mandatory and while probably useful, they are not indispensable in
examining or comparing handwriting. 52 Besides, when the dissimilarity
between the genuine and false specimens of writing is visible to the naked
eye, resort to technical rules is no longer necessary. 53 We quote the
instructive rule of comparison in the examination of forged documents, thus:
As a rule, forgery cannot be presumed and must be proved by
clear, positive and convincing evidence and the burden of proof lies
on the party alleging forgery. The best evidence of a forged signature
in an instrument is the instrument itself reﬂecting the alleged forged
signature. The fact of forgery can only be established by a
comparison between the alleged forged signature and the authentic
and genuine signature of the person whose signature is theorized
upon to have been forged. Without the original document containing
the alleged forged signature, one cannot make a deﬁnitive

comparison which would establish forgery. 54

Here, the evidence presented includes certiﬁed true copy of the PSP
and the PDS. After a careful comparison, we noted stark diﬀerences in the
structure, strokes, form and general appearance of Dampilag's signatures
and handwriting in the PDS and in the PSP. The letters "M," "J," and "N" were
written diﬀerently and the strokes of the signatures were not similar. It
cannot also escape our attention that the purported examinee wrote his
name as "HILARIO D. DAMPILAG" in the PSP and not "HILARIO J. DAMPILAG."
In the circumstances and based on the evidence on record, there is no doubt
that the person who took the December 1, 1996 CSPE is not Dampilag.
Someone impersonated Dampilag and took the examination in behalf of him.
In ﬁne, we hold that the evidence presented before the CSC suﬃciently
proved that Dampilag is guilty of the oﬀenses charged against him. To be
sure, in administrative proceedings, the quantum of evidence required is
only substantial, or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might
accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds equally
reasonable might conceivably opine otherwise. 55 Here, the records bear
more than substantial evidence to support a ﬁnding of guilt against
Dampilag.

Offense and penalty
The CSC modiﬁed the decision of the CSC-CAR and found Dampilag
guilty instead for two counts of serious dishonesty based on the following
grounds: (1) he committed an examination irregularity of impersonation
when he connived and colluded with somebody to take the December 1,
1996 CSPE for and in his behalf; and (2) he employed fraud and falsiﬁcation
of oﬃcial documents in the commission of the dishonest act when he
misrepresented in his PDS dated March 3, 1999 that he passed the
December 1, 1996 CSPE when he did not. 56 The CSC concluded that these
acts separately constitute the oﬀense of serious dishonesty under Section 3
(e) and (g) of CSC Resolution No. 06-0538, otherwise known as the Rules on
the Administrative Offense of Dishonesty, viz.:
Section 3.
The presence of any one of the following
attendant circumstances in the commission of the dishonest act
would constitute the offense of Serious Dishonesty:
xxx xxx xxx
e.
The respondent employed fraud and/or falsiﬁcation of
oﬃcial documents in the commission of the dishonest act related to
his/her employment.
xxx xxx xxx
g.
The dishonest act involves a Civil Service examination
irregularity or fake Civil Service eligibility such as, but not limited to,
impersonation, cheating and use of crib sheets.

Dishonesty means the concealment or distortion of truth in a matter of
fact relevant to one's oﬃce or connected with the performance of his duty.
57 It is "a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive or defraud; untrustworthiness;
lack of integrity, lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of

fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray."
58

For dishonesty to be considered serious, the presence of any one of the
circumstances enumerated in Section 3 of CSC Resolution No. 06-0538 must
be present. 59 In this case, Dampilag falsiﬁed the PDS, an oﬃcial document,
60 by misrepresenting that he passed the December 1, 1996 CSPE when he
did not. In addition, he connived and colluded with someone to impersonate
him and take the December 1, 1996 CSPE for and on his behalf. More
importantly, Dampilag has been beneﬁting from the passing result in the
said examination. Clearly, Dampilag committed two counts of serious
dishonesty under Section 3 (e) and (g) of CSC Resolution No. 06-0538,
respectively.
Damilag is also liable for falsiﬁcation of oﬃcial document. It is a settled
rule in this jurisdiction that the duly accomplished form of the Civil Service is
an oﬃcial document of the Commission. 61 Dampilag falsiﬁed his PDS
accomplished on March 3, 1999 when he indicated therein that he took and
passed the CSPE on December 1, 1996 in Baguio City, with a rating of
81.89%, when in truth and in fact, somebody took the examination for him.
Moreover, under CSC Memorandum Circular No. 15, Series of 1991,
any "act which includes the procurement and/or use of fake/spurious civil
service eligibility, the giving of assistance to ensure the commission or
procurement of the same, cheating, collusion, impersonation, or any other
anomalous act which amounts to any violation of the Civil Service
examination has been categorized as a grave oﬀense of Dishonesty, Grave
Misconduct or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service." Verily,
by colluding and conniving with someone to impersonate him in taking the
December 1, 1996 CSPE, and making untruthful statement in his PDS of his
civil service eligibility, Dampilag is liable for grave misconduct. 62
Section 50 of CSC Resolution No. 1101502, or the Revised Uniform
Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, provides that if the
respondent is found guilty of two or more charges or counts, the penalty to
be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge and the
rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances. 63 Under Section 46,
the oﬀenses of serious dishonesty, falsiﬁcation of oﬃcial documents, and
grave misconduct are all punishable by the penalty of dismissal from the
service. 64
In view of Dampilag's misrepresentation in the PDS that he took and
passed the CSPE on December 1, 1996, and collusion with someone to take
the December 1, 1996 CSPE for and in his behalf, this Court ﬁnds Dampilag
administratively liable for two counts of serious dishonesty, falsiﬁcation of
oﬃcial documents, and grave misconduct. He is meted the penalty of
dismissal with the accessory penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture
of retirement beneﬁts, except accrued leave credits, 65 disqualiﬁcation from
re-employment in the government service, 66 and bar from taking civil
service examinations. 67
FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is

GRANTED. The decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 147131 is
REVERSED and the Decision No. 160324 dated February 29, 2016 and
Resolution No. 1600574 dated June 6, 2016 of the Civil Service Commission
are AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS in that Hilario J. Dampilag is GUILTY
of two counts of Serious Dishonesty, Falsiﬁcation of Oﬃcial Documents, and
Grave Misconduct. He is DISMISSED from the service, with the forfeiture of
his retirement beneﬁts, except terminal/accrued leave credits, and with
prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the
government, including any government-owned or controlled corporations.
Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Civil Service
Commission.
