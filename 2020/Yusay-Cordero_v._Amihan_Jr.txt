FIRST DIVISION
[A.C. No. 12709. September 8, 2020.]
LILIA YUSAY-CORDERO , complainant , vs. ATTY. JUANITO S.
AMIHAN, JR., respondent.

RESOLUTION

LOPEZ, J :
p

We determine in this case the administrative liability of a lawyer who
notarized a document without a notarial commission.


ANTECEDENTS
In 1976, Spouses Hector Cordero (Hector) and Lilia Yusay-Cordero
(Lilia) executed a special power of attorney authorizing Lilia's father, Quirico
Yusay Sr. (Quirico, Sr.), to sell and mortgage a land registered under
Transfer Certiﬁcate of Title No. T-102992. 1 Accordingly, Quirico, Sr.
mortgaged the property to the bank and surrendered the certiﬁcate of title.
On January 22, 2004, Hector passed away. In 2015, Lilia ﬁnished paying the
loan and received back the certiﬁcate of title from the bank. However, Lilia
noticed that there is an annotation 2 on the title pertaining to a "Deed of
Portion Sale" between her, as seller, represented by her father Quirico Sr.,
and Quirico Y. Yusar, Jr. and Alberto Y. Yusay, as buyers. The deed was
notarized on December 11, 2003 by Atty. Juanito S. Amihan, Jr. (Atty.
Amihan, Jr.). 3
Upon veriﬁcation, however, Lilia discovered that Atty. Amihan, Jr. is not
a commissioned notary public in 2003 and that no copy of the deed was
recorded with the Oﬃce of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court
(RTC). 4 Accordingly, Lilia ﬁled an administrative complaint 5 against Atty.
Amihan, Jr. before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for violation of
the Lawyer's Oath and the Canons of Professional Responsibility (CPR). As
evidence, Lilia presented the corresponding certiﬁcations from the clerk of
court. On the other hand, Atty. Amihan, Jr. claimed that he is authorized to
notarize documents in 2003. Atty. Amihan, Jr. presented imprints of his
rubber stamps indicating the details of his notarial commission for the year
2003, 6 the recommendation letter stating that his appointment expired on
December 31, 2003, 7 and the oath of oﬃce 8 and appointment as notary
public in 2004. 9 Nevertheless, Lilia maintained that the rubber stamps do
not establish that Atty. Amihan, Jr. has a valid commission in 2003. 10
On November 21, 2018, the Commission on Bar Discipline found that
Atty. Amihan, Jr. is not a commissioned notary public in 2003, absent a
certiﬁcate of authority and notarial reports/register for that year. Moreover,
it gave credence to the certiﬁcation of the clerk of court over the
recommendation letter and the rubber stamps which do not prove a valid

commission. The investigating commissioner also conﬁrmed with the RTC
that Atty. Amihan, Jr. has no notarial commission in 2003. As such, Atty.
Amihan, Jr. committed deliberate falsehood in violation of the Lawyer's Oath
and Rule 1.01 of the CPR. The Commission recommended a penalty of
immediate revocation of notarial commission, disqualiﬁcation from being
commissioned as a notary public for two years, and suspension from
practice of law for two years, thus:
Contrary to his claim, Respondent does not appear that he was
commissioned as a notary public for and in the City of Bacolod. The
Respondent, for his part, has been completely unable to
submit any kind of proof of his claim that he had a
commission as a notary public for and in the City of Bacolod in
2003, or of his submission of notarial reports and notarial
register during the said period. Respondent has only presented
the imprints of his rubber stamps indicating his notarial commission
details for the year 2003. He failed to establish that he was
certainly commissioned as a notary public nor he wasn't [sic]
able to produce his Certiﬁcate Authority issued by the
Executive Judge which evidences the authenticity of his
commission.
Respondent's claim that his authority to notarize documents is
conformed thru the Recommendation issued by the Regional Trial
Court of Bacolod City does not hold water. It is the Certiﬁcate of
Notarial Act and not the Recommendation of the court which
authorizes and commission a lawyers as a notary public.
xxx xxx xxx
Finally, undersigned Commissioner went out of her way to
inquire with the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City if Respondent
was indeed issued a notarial commission for 2003. She was [in fact]
able to conﬁrm that Respondent had no notarial commission. 11
(Emphases supplied.)

On February 15, 2019, the IBP Board of Governors reduced the penalty
of suspension from the practice of law from two years to one year, viz.:


RESOLVED to ADOPT the ﬁndings of fact and recommendation of the
Investigating Commissioner, with modiﬁcation, to impose upon the
Respondent the penalty of ONE (1) YEAR SUSPENSION FROM THE
PRACTICE OF LAW and TWO (2) YEARS DISQUALIFICATION to hold
commission as Notary Public, and if currently so engaged, be
immediately decommissioned as such. 12

RULING
The Court adopts the IBP's findings with modification as to the penalty.
Notarization ensures the authenticity and reliability of a document. It
converts a private document into a public one, and renders the document
admissible in court without further proof of its authenticity. Courts,
administrative agencies and the public at large must be able to rely upon the
acknowledgment executed by a notary public and appended to a private
instrument. Moreover, notarization is not an empty routine. On the contrary,
it engages public interest in a substantial degree and the protection of that

interest requires preventing those who are not qualiﬁed or authorized to act
as a notary public. 13 Corollarily, a lawyer who notarized a document without
the required commission is guilty of violating the Lawyer's Oath and is
deemed to engage in deliberate falsehood. As aptly explained in Nunga v.
Atty. Viray: 14
Where the notarization of a document is done by a
member of the Philippine Bar at a time when he has no
authorization or commission to do so, the oﬀender may be
subjected to disciplinary action. For one, performing a notarial
without such commission is a violation of the lawyer's oath to
obey the laws, more speciﬁcally, the Notarial Law . Then, too,
by making it appear that he is duly commissioned when he is not, he
is, for all legal intents and purposes, indulging in deliberate
falsehood, which the lawyer's oath similarly proscribes. These
violations fall squarely within the prohibition of Rule 1.01 of Canon 1
of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which provides: "A lawyer
shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful
conduct." 15 (Emphasis supplied.)

Here, it is undisputed that Atty. Amihan, Jr. notarized the deed in 2003.
However, the oﬃce of the clerk of court certiﬁed that Atty. Amihan, Jr. was
not a commissioned notary public in that year and that no copy of the deed
was ﬁled. The investigating commissioner likewise conﬁrmed with the RTC
that Atty. Amihan, Jr. has no notarial commission in 2003. In contrast, Atty.
Amihan, Jr. presented imprints of his rubber stamps for the year 2003. Yet,
they do not contain material information such as his notarial commission
number. Atty. Amihan, Jr. also submitted a recommendation letter stating
that his appointment as notary public expired on December 31, 2003.
Nonetheless, the certiﬁcation from the clerk of court belied the contents of
the letter. The prevailing law at the time of notarization in 2003 was the
Revised Administrative Code which provides that the oath of oﬃce of a
notary public and his commission shall be ﬁled and recorded in the Oﬃce of
the Clerk of Court of the RTC. 16 A certiﬁcation issued by the clerk of court
stating that a lawyer has no notarial commission is suﬃcient to establish
that fact. 17 Indeed, Atty. Amihan, Jr. was unable to submit a copy of his
certiﬁcate of authority for 2003 and his notarial reports and register for that
year. On this point, we stress that in an administrative case against a lawyer,
preponderant evidence is necessary which means that the evidence adduced
by one side is superior to or has greater weight than that of the other. 18 The
burden of proof rests upon the complainant. 19 Verily, Lilia proved that Atty.
Amihan, Jr. was not a commissioned notary public in 2003.
I n Cruz-Villanueva v. Atty. Rivera , 20 the respondent was suspended
from the practice of law for one year and barred from being commissioned
as notary public for one year for notarizing two documents without a notarial
commission. The Court noted that the respondent has no prior administrative
record. 21 In Buensuceso v. Barrera, 22 the respondent was likewise
suspended for one year when he notarized ﬁve documents after his
commission as notary public expired. 23 Considering that this is Atty.
Amihan, Jr.'s ﬁrst infraction and that the case involved only one document,

we deem it proper to impose the penalties of immediate revocation of
notarial commission, disqualiﬁcation from being commissioned as a notary
public for one year, and suspension from the practice of law for a period of
one year.
FOR THESE REASONS, Atty. Juanito S. Amihan, Jr.'s notarial
commission is IMMEDIATELY REVOKED . He is also DISQUALIFIED from
being commissioned as a notary public for a period of one year and
SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of one year. He is likewise
STERNLY WARNED that a repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more
severely.
The suspension in the practice of law, the prohibition from being
commissioned as notary public, and the revocation of his notarial
commission, if any, shall take eﬀect immediately upon respondent's receipt
of this decision. He is DIRECTED to immediately ﬁle a Manifestation to the
Court that his suspension has started, copy furnished all courts and quasijudicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.
Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Oﬃce of the Bar
Conﬁdant to be entered into Atty. Juanito S. Amihan, Jr.'s records. Copies
shall likewise be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the
Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts concerned.
