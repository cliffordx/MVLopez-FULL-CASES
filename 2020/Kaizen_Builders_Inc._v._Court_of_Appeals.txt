DECISION

LOPEZ, J :
p

The nature and eﬀects of a suspension order are the core principles
applied in this consolidated petitions assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA)
Resolution 1 dated December 8, 2015 and Decision 2 dated October 1, 2018
in CA-G.R. CV No. 102330.
ANTECEDENTS
In 2004, Ofelia Ursais (Ofelia) purchased from Kaizen Builders, Inc.
(Kaizen builders) (formerly Megalopolis Properties, Inc.) a house and lot
situated in White Pine Street, Camp 7, Baguio City. 3 In 2007, the parties
executed a contract to sell where Kaizen Builders bought back from Ofelia
the property for P2,700,000.00 and swapped it with another house and lot in
Kingstone Ville, Camp 7, Baguio City. They deducted from the price the
P300,000.00 unpaid balance of Ofelia in White Pine property and the
P2,200,000.00 value of Kingstone Ville property. The remaining P200,000.00
shall be paid in cash. Later, the parties replaced the contract to sell with
another agreement where Ofelia invested the P2,200,000.00 in Kaizen
Builders' development of the Kingstone Ville project. 4 In 2008, however, the
parties rescinded the investment agreement where Ofelia received
P320,000.00 from Kaizen Builders. The parties then stipulated that the
amount of P380,000.00 will be paid on installment basis while the remaining
P1,500,000.00 shall bear an interest of 1.5% or P22,500.00 per month. 5
Despite repeated demands, Kaizen Builders stopped remitting the
monthly interest beginning November 2009 and refused to deliver the
P380,000.00. 6 In 2011, Ofelia ﬁled against Kaizen Builders and its chief
executive oﬃcer Cecille F. Apostol (Cecille) a complaint for sum of money




before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) docketed as Civil Case No. 7426-R. 7
On May 8, 2013, the RTC in its Decision 8 ordered Kaizen Builders and Cecille
solidarily liable to pay Ofelia the following amounts, to wit:
WHEREFORE, all the foregoing premises considered, the Court
rules in favor of plaintiﬀ OFELIA URSAIS. Defendants MEGALOPOLIS
PROPERTIES INCORPORATED and CECILLE F. APOSTOL are solidarily
liable to pay the Plaintiff the following:
1.

the amount of ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
PESOS (P1,500,000.00), which is the amount invested by
Plaintiﬀ Ursais, with legal interest to be computed from
June 17, 2009 until the same is fully paid; and

2.

the amount of ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS (P178,750.00), as
previously computed, representing the unpaid interest of
1.5% per month or P22,500.00 from October 2009 until
June 2010, with legal interest to be computed from June
17, 2010 until the same is fully paid.

The parties bear their own cost, of suit and attorney's fees,
considering the absence of bad faith and fraud, moral and exemplary
damages is [sic] not awarded.
SO ORDERED. 9

Ofelia sought partial reconsideration claiming that the RTC failed to
include the P380,000.00 and the payment of monthly interest up to the
present. Later, Ofelia died and was substituted by her heirs. On November
15, 2013, the RTC granted the motion and amended its Decision, 10 thus:
WHEREFORE, all the foregoing premises considered, the
dispositive portion of the assailed Decision of the Court is amended as
follows:
Defendants MEGALOPOLIS PROPERTIES INCORPORATED and
CECILLE F. APOSTOL are held solidarily liable to pay the Plaintiﬀ Heirs
of Ofelia Ursais the following:
1.

the amount of ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
PESOS (P1,500,000.00), which is the amount invested by
Plaintiﬀ Ursais, with legal interest to be computed from
June 17, 2010 until the same is fully paid;

2.

the amount of THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PESOS
(P380,000.00) as contained in their Rescission Agreement
dated July 25, 2008, with legal interest to be computed
from July 25, 2008 until the same is fully paid; and

3.

the amount of ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS (P179,750.00), as
previously computed, representing the unpaid interest of
1.5% per month or P22,500.00 from October 2009 until
June 2010, with legal interest to be computed from June
17, 2010 until the same is fully paid.

The parties bear their own cost of suit and attorney's fees. No
award as to moral and exemplary damages.




SO ORDERED. 11

Aggrieved, Kaizen Builders and Cecille elevated the case to the CA
docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 102330. Meantime, Kaizen Builders ﬁled before
the special commercial court a petition for corporate rehabilitation docketed
as Special Proceedings Case No. 2466-R. On August 12, 2015, the
rehabilitation court issued a Commencement Order 12 which consolidated all
legal proceedings by and against Kaizen Builders and suspended all actions
for the enforcement of claims against it.
Accordingly, Kaizen Builders and Cecille moved to consolidate the
appealed case with the rehabilitation proceedings. On December 8, 2015,
however, the CA denied the motion and explained that the appeal would not
aﬀect the rehabilitation case since the two proceedings involved diﬀerent
parties, issues and reliefs. 13 Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, 14 Kaizen
Builders and Cecille ﬁled a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition 15 under
Rule 65 before this Court docketed as G.R. No. 226894. They argued that the
CA acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion for
consolidation and prayed that the proceedings before the CA be suspended
within the duration of the rehabilitation case.
On February 14, 2018, the CA resolved to hold in abeyance the
proceedings in CA-G.R. CV No. 102330. Yet, the resolution was subsequently
recalled. 16 On October 1, 2018, the CA rendered a Decision 17 on the merits
of the appeal, viz.:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is
PARTIALLY GRANTED. Accordingly, the 8 May 2013 Decision and the
15 November 2013 Order of the Regional Trial Court of Baguio City,
Branch 60, in Civil Case No. 7426-R are AFFIRMED with
MODIFICATION such that the appellants are hereby ORDERED to pay

from 1 July 2013 until this Decision becomes ﬁnal and

SO ORDERED. 18

Dissatisﬁed, Kaizen Builders and Cecille ﬁled a Petition for Review on
Certiorari 19 under Rule 45 docketed as G.R. No. 247647 on the ground that
the CA committed reversible error in holding them liable to pay Ofelia's
heirs.
RULING
It is the policy of the courts to consolidate cases involving similar
parties and aﬀecting closely related subject matters. The purpose of this rule
is to settle the issues expeditiously and to avoid multiplicity of suits and the
possibility of conﬂicting decisions. 20 Here, the petitions in G.R. Nos. 226894
and 247647 involve similar parties and common questions of law and fact.
Hence, it is imperative upon this Court to consolidate these cases. As will be
discussed, the petitions are dependent on each other such that the Decision
in G.R. No. 226894 is determinative of the outcome in G.R. No. 247647.
Speciﬁcally, in G.R. No. 226894, Kaizen Builders and Cecille ascribed grave
abuse of discretion on the CA in not consolidating CA-G.R. CV No. 102330
with Special Proceedings Case No. 2466-R or at least suspending the
decision on the merits of the appeal pending the rehabilitation case. We ﬁnd
merit in this argument.
Republic Act (RA) No. 10142 or the Financial Rehabilitation and
Insolvency Act of 2010 statutorily deﬁned "rehabilitation" as the restoration
of the debtor to a condition of successful operation and solvency, if it is
shown that its continuance of operation is economically feasible and its
creditors can recover by way of the present value of payments projected in
the plan, more if the debtor continues as a going concern than if it is
immediately liquidated. 21 Case law explains that rehabilitation is an attempt
to conserve and administer the assets of an insolvent corporation in the
hope of its eventual return from ﬁnancial stress to solvency. 22 A corporate
rehabilitation case is a special proceeding in rem 23 where the basic issues
concern the viability and desirability of continuing the business operations of
the distressed corporation. 24 The purpose is to enable the company to gain
a new lease on life and allow its creditors to be paid their claims out of its




earnings. 25 The rationale is to resuscitate businesses in ﬁnancial distress
because assets are often more valuable when so maintained than they
would be when liquidated. 26
To achieve these objectives, Sections 16 and 17 of RA No. 10142
authorizes the rehabilitation court to issue a Commencement Order that
includes a Stay Order, which have the eﬀects of suspending all actions for
the enforcement of claims against the debtor and consolidating the
resolution of all legal proceedings by and against it, to wit:
SECTION 16.
Commencement of Proceedings and Issuance of a
Commencement Order. — The rehabilitation proceedings shall
commence upon the issuance of the Commencement Order, which
shall:
xxx xxx xxx
(q)

include a Stay or Suspension Order which shall:

(1)

suspend all actions or proceedings, in court or
otherwise, for the enforcement of claims against the
debtor;
xxx xxx xxx

SECTION 17.
Eﬀects of the Commencement Order. — Unless
otherwise provided for in this Act, the court's issuance of a
Commencement Order shall, in addition to the eﬀects of a Stay or
Suspension Order described in Section 16 hereof:
xxx xxx xxx
(e)

consolidate the resolution of all legal proceedings by and
against the debtor to the court: Provided, however, That
the court may allow the continuation of cases in other
courts where the debtor had initiated the suit.

Attempts to seek legal or other recourse against the debtor
outside these proceedings shall be suﬃcient to support a ﬁnding of
indirect contempt of court. (Emphases supplied.)

Indeed, an essential function of corporate rehabilitation is the
mechanism of suspension of all actions and claims against the distressed
corporation. 27 Notably, RA No. 10142 makes no distinction as to the claims
that are suspended once a Commencement Order is issued. Apropos is
Section 4 (c) which provides an all-encompassing deﬁnition of the term
"claim," thus:
SECTION 4.

Definition of Terms. — As used in this Act, the term:
xxx xxx xxx

(c)

Claim shall refer to all claims or demands of whatever
nature or character against the debtor or its property,
whether for money or otherwise, liquidated or
unliquidated, ﬁxed or contingent, matured or unmatured,
disputed or undisputed, including, but not limited to: (1) all
claims of the government, whether national or local, including
taxes, tariﬀs and customs duties; and (2) claims against directors
and oﬃcers of the debtor arising from acts done in the discharge

of their functions falling within the scope of their authority:
Provided, That, this inclusion does not prohibit the creditors or
third parties from ﬁling cases against the directors and oﬃcers
acting in their personal capacities. (Emphases supplied.)

To clarify, however, creditors of the distressed corporation are not
without remedy as they may still submit their claims to the rehabilitation
court for proper consideration so that they may participate in the
proceedings, keeping in mind the general policy of the law to ensure or
maintain certainty and predictability in commercial aﬀairs, preserve and
maximize the value of the assets of these debtors, recognize creditor rights
and respect priority of claims, and ensure equitable treatment of creditors
who are similarly situated. In other words, the creditors must ventilate their
claims before the rehabilitation court. Any attempt to seek legal or other
resource against the distressed corporation shall be suﬃcient to support a
finding of indirect contempt of court. 28
Thus, the Commencement Order shall direct all creditors to ﬁle their
claims with the rehabilitation court at least ﬁve days before the initial
hearing. 29 A creditor whose claim is not listed in the schedule of debts and
liabilities and who fails to ﬁle a notice of claim in accordance with the
Commencement Order but subsequently ﬁles a belated claim shall not be
entitled to participate in the rehabilitation proceedings but shall be entitled
to receive distributions arising therefrom. 30 The 2013 Financial
Rehabilitation Rules of Procedure or A.M. No. 12-12-11-SC echoed the
manner of filing the creditors' claims, to wit:
RULE 2
COURT-SUPERVISED REHABILITATION
xxx xxx xxx
B.

Notice of Claim. — Every creditor of the debtor or any
interested party whose claim is not yet listed in the schedule of debts
and liabilities shall ﬁle his veriﬁed notice of claim not later than ﬁve
(5) days before the ﬁrst initial hearing date ﬁxed in the
Commencement Order.
If a creditor ﬁles a belated claim, he shall not be entitled to
participate in the proceedings but shall be entitled to receive
distributions arising therefrom if recommended and approved by the
rehabilitation receiver, and approved by the court.
xxx xxx xxx
SEC. 14.
Action at the Initial Hearing. — After making a
determination that the jurisdictional requirements have been
complied with, the court shall:
(A)

determine the creditors who have made timely and proper ﬁling
of their notice of claims and issue an order that the creditors not
named therein shall not be entitled to participate in the
proceedings but shall be entitled to receive distributions arising

from the proceedings;
xxx xxx xxx

Verily, the reason behind the imperative nature of a stay order in
relation to the creditors' claims cannot be downplayed. The indiscriminate
suspension of actions for claims is intended to expedite the rehabilitation of
the distressed corporation. It enables the management committee or the
rehabilitation receiver to eﬀectively exercise its/his powers free from any
judicial or extrajudicial interference that might unduly hinder or prevent the
rescue of the debtor company. To allow such other actions to continue would
only add to the burden of the management committee or rehabilitation
receiver, whose time, eﬀort and resources would be wasted in defending
claims against the corporation. 31 Corollarily, the date when the claim arose,
or when the action was ﬁled, has no bearing at all in deciding whether the
action or claim is suspended. The stay order embraces all phases of the suit,
32 except in those instances expressly mentioned in Section 18 of RA No.
10142, viz.:
SECTION 18.
Exceptions to the Stay or Suspension Order. — The
Stay or Suspension Order shall not apply:
(a)

to cases already pending appeal in the Supreme Court as
of commencement date: Provided, That any ﬁnal and
executory judgment arising from such appeal shall be referred to
the court for appropriate action:

(b)

subject to the discretion of the court, to cases pending or ﬁled
at a specialized court or quasi-judicial agency which, upon
determination by the court, is capable of resolving the claim
more quickly, fairly and eﬃciently than the court: Provided, That
any ﬁnal and executory judgment of such court or agency shall
be referred to the court and shall be treated as a non-disputed
claim;

(c)

to the enforcement of claims against sureties and other persons
solidarily liable with the debtor, and third party or
accommodation mortgagors as well as issuers of letters of credit,
unless the property subject of the third party or accommodation
mortgage is necessary for the rehabilitation of the debtor as
determined by the court upon recommendation by the
rehabilitation receiver;

(d)

to any form of action of customers or clients of a securities
market participant to recover or otherwise claim moneys and
securities entrusted to the latter in the ordinary course of the
latter's business as well as any action of such securities market
participant or the appropriate regulatory agency or selfregulatory organization to pay or settle such claims or liabilities;

(e)

to the actions of a licensed broker or dealer to sell pledged
securities of a debtor pursuant to a securities pledge or margin
agreement for the settlement of securities transactions in
accordance with the provisions of the Securities Regulation Code
and its implementing rules and regulations;

(f)

the clearing and settlement of ﬁnancial transactions through the

facilities of a clearing agency or similar entities duly authorized,
registered and/or recognized by the appropriate regulatory
agency like the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the SEC as
well as any form of actions of such agencies or entities to
reimburse themselves for any transactions settled for the debtor;
and
(g)

any criminal action against the individual debtor or owner,
partner, director or oﬃcer of a debtor shall not be aﬀected by
any proceeding commenced under this Act. (Emphasis supplied.)

In Lingkod Manggagawa sa Rubberworld, Adidas-Anglo v. Rubberworld
(Phils.), Inc., 33 this Court aﬃrmed the CA's ﬁnding that the Labor Arbiter and
the National Labor Relations Commission committed grave abuse of
discretion when they proceeded with the unfair labor practice case that the
petitioner ﬁled against the respondent despite the Securities and Exchange
Commission's suspension order. In that case, the decisions and orders of the
labor tribunals are void and could not have achieved a ﬁnal and executory
status, thus:
Given the factual milieu obtaining in this case, it cannot be said
that the decision of the Labor Arbiter, or the decision/dismissal order
and writ of execution issued by the NLRC, could ever attain ﬁnal and
executory status. The Labor Arbiter completely disregarded and
violated Section 6(c) of Presidential Decree 902-A, as
amended, which categorically mandates the suspension of all
actions for claims against a corporation placed under a
management committee by the SEC. Thus, the proceedings
before the Labor Arbiter and the order and writ subsequently
issued by the NLRC are all null and void for having been
undertaken or issued in violation of the SEC suspension Order
dated December 28, 1994. As such, the Labor Arbiter's decision,
including the dismissal by the NLRC of Rubberworld's appeal, could
not have achieved a final and executory status.
Acts executed against the provisions of mandatory or
prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself
authorizes their validity. The Labor Arbiter's decision in this
case is void ab initio, and therefore, non-existent. A void
judgment is in eﬀect no judgment at all. No rights are divested by it
nor obtained from it. Being worthless in itself, all proceedings upon
which the judgment is founded are equally worthless. It neither binds
nor bars anyone. All acts performed under it and all claims ﬂowing
out of it are void. In other words, a void judgment is regarded as a
nullity, and the situation is the same as it would be if there were no
judgment. It accordingly leaves the party-litigants in the same
position they were in before the trial. 34 (Emphases supplied;
citations omitted.)

Likewise, in La Savoie Development Corp. v. Buenavista Properties,
Inc. ,
the respondent ﬁled a complaint for termination of contract and
recovery of property with damages against petitioner before the RTC of
Quezon City. Meantime, the petitioner ﬁled rehabilitation proceedings before
the RTC of Makati City which issued a suspension order. The petitioner then
informed the RTC of Quezon City about the order but it had already decided
35

the complaint. Thereafter, the judgment became ﬁnal and executory. Later,
the RTC of Makati City approved a rehabilitation plan which reduced the
penalty stated in the decision of the RTC of Quezon City. Undaunted, the
respondent questioned the reduction of penalty and argued that the RTC of
Makati City cannot amend the ﬁnal decision of the RTC of Quezon City. The
respondent insisted that the cram down power of the rehabilitation court is
irrelevant and inapplicable. In that case, we held that a decision rendered in
violation of a stay order did not attain finality, viz.:
We see no reason not to apply the rule in Lingkod in
case of violation of a stay order under the Interim Rules.
Having been executed against the provisions of a mandatory
law, the QC RTC Decision did not attain finality.
xxx xxx xxx
Necessarily, we reject respondent's contention that the
Rehabilitation Court cannot exercise its cram-down power to approve
a rehabilitation plan over the opposition of a creditor. Since the QC
RTC Decision did not attain ﬁnality, there is no legal
impediment to reduce the penalties under the ARRP.
Further, we have already held that a court-approved
rehabilitation plan may include a reduction of liability. x x x.
(Emphasis supplied.)

Here, it is undisputed that Kaizen Builders ﬁled a petition for corporate
rehabilitation. Finding the petition suﬃcient in form and substance, the
rehabilitation court issued a Commencement Order on August 12, 2015 or
during the pendency of the appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 102330. Yet, the CA
proceeded with the case and rendered judgment. On this point we ﬁnd grave
abuse of discretion. To reiterate, the Commencement Order ipso jure
suspended the proceedings in the CA at whatever stage it may be,
considering that the appeal emanated from a money claim against a
distressed corporation which is deemed stayed pending the rehabilitation
case. Moreover, the appeal before the CA is not one of the instances where a
suspension order is inapplicable. The CA should have abstained from
resolving the appeal. 36 Taken together, the CA clearly defied the effects of a
Commencement Order and disregarded the state policy to encourage
debtors and their creditors to collectively and realistically resolve and adjust
competing claims and property rights. 37 Applying the pronouncements in
Lingkod Manggagawa sa Rubberworld and La Savoie Development Corp., the
CA's Resolution dated December 8, 2015 and Decision dated October 1,
2018 in CA-G.R. CV No. 102330 are void for having been rendered with grave
abuse of discretion and against the provisions of a mandatory law. With
ﬁndings warranting the grant of the petition for certiorari and prohibition in
G.R. No. 226894, there is no more reason for this Court to decide the
petition for review in G.R. No. 247647 sans a valid judgment.
FOR THESE REASONS, the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition in
G.R. No. 226894 is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals' Resolution dated
December 8, 2015 and Decision dated October 1, 2018 in CA-G.R. CV No.
102330 are declared VOID. The proceedings in the Court of Appeals are




SUSPENDED during the pendency of the corporate rehabilitation case.
Accordingly, Kaizen Builders, Inc. is DIRECTED to quarterly update the Court
of Appeals as to the status of its ongoing rehabilitation. The petition for
review in G.R. No. 247647 is DISMISSED.
SO ORDERED.
