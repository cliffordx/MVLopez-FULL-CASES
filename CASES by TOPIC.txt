  259: the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 are diﬀerent.
  260  In CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, the question is whether Judge Sescon committed
  261  grave abuse of discretion in enforcing the compromise agreement. On the
  262: other hand, the issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 is whether Judge Lilagan was
  263  correct in implementing the previously quashed writ of execution dated July

  340  "conclusiveness of judgment." Stated diﬀerently, any right, fact or
  341: matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the
  342  determination of an action before a competent court in which

  364  was the very order assailed in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. Undoubtedly, the
  365: issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, both concern the

  176: ISSUES
  177  Stripped of the non-essentials, the issues for our resolution are:

  210  urgency and necessity to be entitled to a WPI. Also, they contend that the CA
  211: has no jurisdiction to issue a WPI against the implementation of the Joint
  212  Memorandum because the questioned act was done in the exercise of a

  225  The CA found that Meridien's cause of action was hinged upon its
  226: CEZA-issued license to operate jai alai, which the Joint Memorandum
  227  allegedly violated. As CEZA's authority to grant the license to operate jai alai

  237  in 2016. The Court ordered the CA to give due course to CEZA's mandamus
  238: on appeal, wherein the issue on CEZA's authority to grant license to operate
  239  jai alai activities must be resolved. 40 Accordingly, the CA should have
  240  LIFTED motu proprio the questioned WPI, and proceeded to resolve the main
  241: issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 120236. 41 Also, we could have conveniently
  242  dismissed this Petition on the ground of mootness. But the grave error
  243  committed by the CA in issuing the WPI constrains us to resolve the
  244: substantive issues raised in this Petition to clarify and put into perspective
  245  the dichotomy of judicial courtesy and the issuance of WPI.

  247  application of the principle of judicial courtesy on cases that would render
  248: the issues before the higher court moot. 42 Its exercise is always considered
  249  to be the exception rather than the rule. 43 In Trajano v. Uniwide Sales

  252  Under Section 7, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the higher court
